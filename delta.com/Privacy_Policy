Privacy Policy


Date effective: January 7, 2013

This Privacy Policy describes our practices related to the use, storage and disclosure of information we collect from or about you in the course of providing commercial air travel services at Delta.com and through our Fly Delta App.   Delta reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will post any changes on delta.com so please check regularly for the most recent version of our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations.
If you have any further questions or comments, contact us using the Email Us page.









Our Mobile Application


PRIVACY POLICY FOR DELTA AIR LINES MOBILE APPLICATIONS
This Privacy Policy describes our practices related to the use, storage and disclosure of information we collect from or about you in the course of providing commercial air travel services through our Fly Delta App.  For policies related to your use of our Website, visit delta.com.   Delta reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. The privacy policy link within the App will point your device to our most current policy, so please check regularly for the most recent version of our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations.

Information About You (information you type in)




After download, the App solicits information from you.  You may access most tools and features either as a guest, or logged in with your SkyMiles credentials, including SkyMiles number, last name and SkyMiles account password.  Logging in allows the added convenience of access to SkyMiles account information if needed while traveling.  However, if you do not log in and use the application as a guest, you still have access to most features. 
You are given the option to enter travel-related and personal information while using certain features of the App. The App allows you to enter and store personal information for use in travel clearance functions. The information you enter may include first and last name, passport or government ID (number, country of issue, expiration date), passenger redress number, gender, date of birth, and country of residence.  To use the feature allowing direct payment of baggage and travel-related fees through the App, you will need to provide your payment information, including payment card number, expiration date and billing address.  You may also choose to store photos and text notes for parking and travel reminders, along with company travel information, travel preferences and phone or e-mail contact information needed to communicate with others in transit.





Automatic Access and Data Collection from Your Device




The App may access certain device information and/or components automatically.  This access is only for the purpose of providing the services within the App you choose to use.
A push notification token (not your native manufacturer device ID) will be used to send push notifications to your mobile device with updates for flight times, gate changes and flight cancellations.  The App will activate your camera if you choose to take a picture for a parking reminder, and store the photo.  If you choose, the App can access your device calendar to save itinerary information in your personal schedule.  It can also bring up your default e-mail program to enable you to send notes and reminders while traveling.  The calendar and photo functions are user-initiated.





Location Information




If you have first provided permission through your device, Delta may obtain pinpointed physical location information from technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity. You are able to withdraw your permission for Delta to acquire pinpointed location information from your device through your device settings, although Delta does not control this process.  The App can use the geo-location features (GPS or network-based) to support your use of location-based tools such as airport/map views, city code search, displaying local Delta Sky Clubs, and locating parking spaces.





How We Use Information About You and Your Device




We collect and use the information about you and your device collected through this App, as well as other information obtained from our website or network and your device, your account, to maintain and provide you with the Services, to respond to your questions and instructions, to maintain the integrity of our network and address security issues, to investigate or take action regarding violations or suspected violations of law or our terms, and to improve such Services.
At times, we may promote the Fly Delta app via internet advertising.  If you click on such an advertisement on an external web site and navigate directly to the iTunes App Store or other platform, non-identifying information such as your phone’s device number may be sent to the advertising network, so that they and we may track the effectiveness (i.e., conversions) of our advertising.
In addition to conversion events, it might also be used for frequency capping, estimating the number of unique users, debugging, or security and fraud detection.





Tracking Preferences and Opt-Out




You may at any time opt-out from further allowing the App’s access to your location data by disabling location tracking features as provided in your native device settings features.
You may also refrain from using application features that collect specific types of data.
You may opt-out of all information collection by uninstalling the App.  You may use the standard uninstall, application and data management processes available as part of your mobile device or via the removal features provided in your chosen mobile app store or network.  Once you have uninstalled the App, all information it stored is deleted, including any preferences you previously set around location permissions and whether you've allowed Delta to send you push notifications. Once the App is uninstalled and preferences are deleted, the push notifications stop.
When you use Fly Delta, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes.  We don’t store the ID, or share the ID or other unique information collected or used by the app with third parties, except for service providers such as Adobe, whose analytics product generates this ID to track and analyze the performance of our app.  We do not use information gathered within the app to serve you targeted advertisements. The “limit ad tracking” or similar advertising-related privacy settings offered by device manufacturers do not change how your device is tracked by Delta.

Sharing With Social Media




You may wish to share information and activities from this app with social media platforms. To utilize social media sharing features, you will be prompted to grant permissions within those platforms, as you choose.   For Facebook updates, you will need to allow account login and publishing permissions.  This enables you to: post questions and content to a feed, upload photos/videos, add likes and comments, create notes and post to events and groups.  To facilitate login, the app will store your account credentials for the appropriate social media platform.
Activity and data shared from the app to these platforms is covered by the internal privacy policy of each platform.





Data Retention




The App will store user- provided data for as long as you use the related feature of the App, unless you choose to delete it.  Only information provided for travel clearance, purchases and related activities will be stored in our operational systems as needed to provide your requested services.  As with the website, if you delete your Delta Sky Miles Account, we will delete the data stored in that account.





Security




Information Security is important to Delta. We have established appropriate physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect from or about our users. These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data.





Website Policy, Not This Policy, Applies to delta.com Interactions




When you access our website, at www.Delta.com or m.delta.com, including from your mobile device, your activities are subject to our terms of use and privacy policy, as stated there.  This policy applies to your device-based interactions with the Fly Delta app only.





Changes




This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, as new versions of the App and service offerings are modified or expanded   You may visit Delta’s Privacy and Security page to view a current copy of our Mobile Privacy Policy.

These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your purchases, remember your SkyMiles number and facilitate effective site administration. We use the information we collect to enhance your visit to delta.com and to provide you with information tailored to your needs.
Your Internet browser(s) may offer you the option to refuse cookies; however, doing so may affect your use of some portions of Delta’s and our partners' web services. Please refer to your browser options or other browser instructional materials to learn more about cookie management.
Delta has engaged third party tracking and advertising providers such as DoubleClick to act on Delta's behalf to track and analyze your usage of our sites through the use of cookies, pixel tags / web beacons, and similar technologies. These third parties collect, and share with us, as we may request, web site usage information about visits to our sites, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our sites, help us target our Internet banner advertisements on our sites and on other sites, and track use of our Internet banner advertisements and other links from our marketing partners' sites to our sites.

To see further information about cookies on delta.com and opt out of some as you choose, see the descriptions and links below. To learn about the available mechanisms for opting out of cookies and technologies related to interest-based advertising, see the descriptions and links below.

The website at Delta.com, whether accessed on a computer or a mobile device, is not at this time configured to read or respond to “do not track” settings or signals in your browser headings, which vary by browser provider.  In lieu of a browser-based opt-out solution, we have identified below certain Digital Advertising Alliance and other approved methods for placement of “opt-out” cookies.  Our site and those of our third party advertisers or other vendors are configured to read and honor these opt-out cookies, so long as they are present on your computer. (If you delete all cookies, you will need to reset your opt-out cookies.)  Specific instructions on how to do so follow.  However, please be aware that Delta does not control these opt-out processes. 
When you use the Fly Delta, mobile app, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes.  We don’t store the ID, or share the ID or other unique information collected or used by the app with third parties, except for service providers such as Adobe, whose analytics product generates this ID to track and analyze the performance of our app.  We do not use information gathered within the app to serve you targeted advertisements.

With Whom Does Delta Share My Personally Identifiable Information?


We do not sell your name or other personally identifiable information to third parties, and do not intend to do so in the future. We routinely share your information with our SkyMiles Partners and Promotional Partners and our subsidiaries including Delta Connection® Carriers. From time to time, we may engage third parties to process your information on our behalf, or to assist us in improving our services and/or products; however, Delta requires that these third parties comply with Delta’s Privacy Policy when processing your information. When you purchase services or products through Delta that are to be provided by another party (for example, a travel segment on another carrier, hotel accommodations, or rental car), we share your information with the third-party so that the third-party can provide the services or products you requested. We may also receive information about you from the third-party providers. We may share with third parties anonymous, aggregated information about all our users.

Please note that the security regulations of several countries may require us to provide foreign and domestic government agencies with access to the data you disclose to us and data that we have about you and your travel plans, history, or status.
We may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process. Personally identifiable information and travel data may also be collected, used, processed and transferred to facilitate travel, including obtaining immigration and customs clearance, and to comply with, or assist in the development of, security or safety measures for passengers, baggage or cargo.   We reserve the right to collect, use, process and disclose personally identifiable information and travel data  to protect the rights or property of Delta, our customers, our websites, or their users, for fraud detection or prevention, for the prevention, detection, apprehension or prosecution of criminal acts or when we believe in good faith that it is in the interest of aviation security or that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.
If your ticket is purchased pursuant to a corporate incentive agreement, we may disclose personally identifiable information concerning your travel to your employer or corporate travel manager.








How Do I Opt Out of Being Contacted by Delta for Promotional Purposes?


You may request to be removed from Delta's informational and promotional email subscription lists or designate email preferences several ways:

You can log in and visit our SkyMiles Partners and Promotional Partners on delta.com if you want to modify your subscription, email and contact preferences.
You may contact us by using the Email Us page if you have questions about removing your name from our subscription lists.
You may call our Customer Care Offices at +1-404-773-0305 if you have any questions about changing your contact preference or require assistance in removing your name from our subscription lists.
Assistance in changing contact preferences for those with disabilities is available at +1-404-209-3434.









How Does Delta Comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)?


Delta does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian may contact us by using the Email Us page, and we will remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any promotional contact opportunities.








Links


This site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites, and Delta’s Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected from you by those sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each site that collects information from you. When you are leaving our site via a link to interact with a site that is not governed by our privacy policy, a new browser window will open. If your interaction with our site will require sending your information to a third-party site that is not governed by our privacy policy, we will clearly inform you before your information is sent.








Security


Information Security is important to Delta. We have established appropriate physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect in accordance with our Privacy Policy. These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data.









Changes


This privacy policy is current as of the effective date stated on this page. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  You may visit Delta's Privacy and Security page periodically to view the most current copy of our Privacy Policy.








PROMOTIONAL PARTNERS


We want to give you more opportunities to earn miles. One of the ways we do this is by sharing your information with Promotional Partners. Typically, these promotional offerings are limited in in quantity and geographic reach and targeted to specific demographic audiences. If you fall within the audience a Promotional Partner is trying to reach, you may receive a promotional e-mail or direct mail.
Of course, if you do not want to receive a promotional mailing from one of these partners, you can always opt-out via e-mail or by calling the SkyMiles Service Center at 800-323-2323.

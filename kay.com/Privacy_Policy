Security: Is it safe for me to order by credit card?



Kay.com has been approved by VeriSign to protect your credit card and other confidential information with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. And we have been authorized by VeriSign to display the VeriSign Secured Seal, an industry-recognized trust mark available for display on any website that protects its customers' confidential information using VeriSign services. Additionally, kay.com has taken measures to ensure that shopping on the kay.com website is a safe and enjoyable experience for our valued customers. At kay.com we use SSL technology, the industry standard for secure online transactions, to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. As a result of our use of SSL technology, placing an order with kay.com online is just as safe as providing your credit card number over the telephone. In the unlikely event of credit card fraud, we will work with your credit card company to resolve the issue. Typically, credit card holders are not responsible for any fraudulent charges.




Will information I submit in connection with a credit application be protected?



Online credit applications are processed through a secure server using encryption keys.




What other data security measures does kay.com have in place?



In accordance with industry custom, we enforce commercially reasonable security measures which are commensurate with the sensitivity of the personal information (including encryption using SSL technology) in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of personal information that we have collected from you on the kay.com website.

This Notice applies to:
Personal information we obtain from people interacting with our websites, products, services, and applications.



But not to:
Content of websites we occasionally link to, and which are operated by companies not affiliated with McAfee.
									Nor to employee records.











We use data to:





Safeguard devices and systems



Manage our relationship with you



Improve security products and services



Protect Data

Protect Data








Protecting your data from security threats is our business
Every time you turn on a device, connect to a network, or open a file, you face significant risk from hackers, spammers, malware, spyware, and other forms of unauthorized access to data and systems.








We work to reduce these threats in three key ways:

Analyzing data sent to and from your devices for risks, threats, vulnerabilities, suspicious activity, and attacks;
Assessing the reputation of the sending and receiving device to see whether access should be allowed; and
Adapting responses to new threats based on intelligence from your device and our global network.









We protect all types of data
We collect personal, machine, and network/activity information when you obtain or use McAfee products, services or when you communicate with a device using McAfee services.




McAfee collects some information that is personal (i.e., information that identifies an individual either alone or in combination with other data).
McAfee also collects non-personal information that does not, on its own, identify an individual person.
When non-personal information is combined with other information so that it does identify an individual person, we treat that combination as personally identifiable information.









It takes data to protect data




A bot is software that automatically does things when triggered to do so. Its name comes from "robot."
A virus is software that spreads from one computer or device usually without the users permission. Like viruses in humans, viruses in computers or devices affect functionality. A virus can be a bot (and visa versa).
Malware is software that can harm you or your computer or device.




The more we know about a system or device that manages data under our protection, the better we can predict threats and protect you, your devices, and your information.











We protect you 24/7
Here are some data intensive tasks that allow us to provide security and privacy protection:





Spam protection
Virus protection
Intrusion protection
Threat prediction and prevention


 


Data encryption
Data loss prevention
Mobile lockdown
Home network defense









When you give it to us, we collect your personal and non-personal data 




We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13 without proper parental consent. Parents or guardians may sign up the entire family for security protection.





We collect your personal information when you or someone acting on your behalf provides it to us. We also collect information when you obtain or use McAfee products, services or when you communicate with a device using Mcafee's services.

We use data to provide up-to-date protection


Our products and services may process certain data to check if files relating to these products and services need to be refreshed or updated. We use aggregated reports to analyze the frequency and prevalence of particular threats.













We depend on IP addresses and other machine data to provide protection



 An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device -- like a computer, printer, mobile phone, or server -- participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It is how devices find each other on a network.
 IP addresses are an example of machine data that is crucial to security and privacy services. Though sometimes IP addresses are associated with a single individual's system, they most often are associated with a group of systems, one system shared by many users or a gateway into a group of systems or devices.
For instance, eMail IP addresses are usually associated with an email service provider and not a device.




One of our tech gurus explains IP addresses:


































We use “cookies” to manage our websites and user preferences




A cookie is a piece of data stored by a website within a browser, to be remembered for when you return to the same website.
The information gathered by cookies is necessary to provide some McAfee services, including certain subscriptions and automatic updates. We cannot provide such services to users who do not give their consent to the data processing carried out through cookies, or whose browsers are set to reject all cookies.











We use cookies and other technology to help us maximize the performance of our website and services



Cookies are used to identify the version of McAfee products you've purchased, so that we can alert you when a newer version is available or if your subscription is about to expire or terminate.
Cookies may be used to control the type and frequency of communications we send you.
We use “web beacons” (small transparent image files) to count visitors to our sites and analyze how visitors use our sites. We don't need to know who you are to do this.
We maintain log files of the traffic that visits our sites. These log files may include information such as your requests, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and other cookies that may uniquely identify a system.
We may work with third-party as vendors to provide relevant content.
For more information about cookies and how McAfee responds to "do not track" signals, please see our Cookie Notice.

Authorized service providers and partners who perform services for us (such as data storage, marketing, sales, fraud investigations and bill collection) based on our instructions. These third parties may only use or disclose personal information obtained from McAfee to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal obligations.
Third parties with your consent. For example, co-marketing with a business partner or sharing limited information as necessary with researchers and analysts.
Other business entities legally related to McAfee, such as our parent company, Intel, Inc. or any third party that may take over all or part of McAfee's functions in the future (provided that such party agrees to use such personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice).
We may also disclose personal information: (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process ; (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities or other authorized third-parties; (iii) as may be required for purposes of national security; (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary and appropriate to prevent physical, mental, financial or other harm, injury or loss; or (v) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal or inappropriate activity or exposure to liability.
McAfee family companies may share personal information with each other and use it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice. We may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
When we share personal information with a third party they must contractually agree to comply with standards at least as stringent as McAfee's when we are handling similar data.  When you provide data directly to the third-party, the processing is based on their standards (which may not be the same as McAfee's) and your own independent relationship with that provider.

                     Privacy Overview
                

Privacy is important to Blackboard and the teachers, learners and educational institutions that we serve. Blackboard is committed to following both legal obligations and best practices with regard to the collection, protection, use and storage of private information. We also support the privacy policies of your educational institution.




                     Privacy:  Your Institution, Blackboard And You
                

Blackboard provides certain products run by educational institutions at non-Blackboard sites. For such products, Blackboard recommends that you consult with your educational institution's privacy policies. Blackboard provides a number of configuration options to allow such institutions to implement their privacy guidelines within our products.Blackboard products, websites, and other services may also connect with or be run as managed services or software-as-a-service offerings from within Blackboard or third-party datacenters located around the world. Use of such products, websites, and services may result in collection of private information by Blackboard. Please see our privacy policy located here to learn more about the information we collect, store, use and share. By using such products, websites, and services, you consent to the practices disclosed in the privacy policy.




                     Cookies And Related Technologies 
                

Cookies and Related Technologies installed on end user terminal devices.The European Union has enacted privacy laws and regulations which seek to better inform users about the use of cookies and other related technologies that are installed on end user devices. These technologies may be used for supporting application functionality such as secure login or storing user preferences, improving application performance and tracking usage. PLEASE CONSULT COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE REGULATIONS.To help with compliance with this regulation, Blackboard has provided the following summaries about the use of cookies within Blackboard Products and Services.Cookies and Privacy Information for Blackboard LearnCookies and Privacy Information for Blackboard xpLorCookies and Privacy Information for Xythos FilerCookies and Privacy Information for Xythos DriveCookies and Privacy Information for SafeAssignCookies and Privacy Information for Blackboard DriveCookies and Privacy Information for ANGEL LMSCookies and Privacy Information for CE VistaCookies and Privacy Information for CourseSitesCookies and Privacy Information for Collaborate - LTI for Voice/ClassroomCookies and Privacy Information for Collaborate - PlanCookies and Privacy Information for Collaborate - PublishCookies and Privacy Information for Collaborate - Voice AuthoringCookies and Privacy Information for Collaborate - Web ConferencingCookies and Privacy Information for Collaborate - Wimba ClassroomCookies and Privacy Information for Mobile CentralCookies and Privacy Information for Mobile LearnCookies and Privacy Information for Mobile Portal




                     Support for SSL Encryption
                

Any institution may choose to run its Blackboard Learn solution under SSL. SSL is a browser technology that encrypts the data transmitted between your computer and the Blackboard server. SSL websites have an address that begins with https:// instead of http:// (note the additional “s”). Blackboard strongly encourages all schools to run under SSL to ensure data privacy of transmitted data and to secure the transmission of login and password information.




                     Blackboard Social
                

The Blackboard Social functionality includes the ability of its users to determine appropriate privacy settings for users' data, subject to limitations imposed by the users' applicable institutions. All users of the social media functionality are solely responsible for monitoring and updating their privacy settings on a regular basis, in order to help protect the privacy of the users' data in accordance with the users' preferences.

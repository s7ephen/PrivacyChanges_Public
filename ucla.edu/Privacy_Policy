		site usage associated with individual IP addresses. 
		UCLA works in a distributed information technology environment; therefore,

Site History
The first UCLA home page in September 1993 was a simple 
		welcome. In May 1995 came the full-featured "InfoUCLA." 
		In February 1997, "Planet UCLA" was launched (with a spinning 
		globe). The "Great Futures" design was adopted in June 2000. 
		The "Here. Now. UCLA" design was launched in late October 2004; 
		the updated version of "Here. Now. UCLA" dates to November 2008. 
		The site is managed by 
		UCLA Communications & Public Outreach.

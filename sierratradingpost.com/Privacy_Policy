2. Traditional Exchanges, Replacements, and Returns
If you prefer a Traditional Exchange, Replacement, or Return simply fill out the form on the back of your invoice and use the prepaid UPS return shipping label included within your package (merchandise returns for refund may be subject to a return shipping fee of $6.95 for 48 contiguous U.S. and $10.95 for AK, HI). We will process your return or exchange after it arrives (please note: requests for item exchange using the traditional method will be subject to availability). For traditional exchange and replacement requests, a $2.95 shipping fee will apply to the new order.
If you choose not to use our prepaid label, you will be responsible for paying all return shipping costs up front.

Please send your return to:
Sierra Trading Post
Attn: Returns
5025 Campstool Rd
Cheyenne, WY 82007-1898

Please follow the packing and return instructions to ensure prompt service:

Please clean any garments and repack items in sturdy packaging
Please include a copy of your invoice in the box
If you do not have your invoice, check your email and reprint the invoice if you went through our online exchange/return program. Otherwise, please enclose your Customer Number, Full Name and Billing Address with your return package. Enclosing this information helps us expedite your return.
If you use the Return Label included with your original order, a return shipping fee will be charged for all returns. This fee covers return shipping from you to us.
For the nearest UPS drop-off location visit  http://www.ups.com and select the Locations Tab to find a drop-off location near you.
If you need to use an alternate carrier for the return, use the return address label and make sure that your package is prepaid and insured. COD packages will not be accepted.

PayPal and PayPal Credit Exchanges & Returns
Returns made after 6 months of the purchase date will be issued a merchandise credit in accordance with our normal Return Policy. For PayPal and PayPal Credit (formerly Bill Me Later), returns made prior to 6 months from the date of purchase will be refunded to your PayPal or PayPal Credit account, or you will be issued a refund check.
Exchanges for orders placed using PayPal and PayPal Credit are different than our normal exchange policies. If you need to make an exchange, we can give you a merchandise credit for your return (following the returns guidelines mentioned above), then you may place a new order for the item you want. Since items tend to sell out quickly; we recommend immediately placing an order for replacement items.

			+ '<h3><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></h3>'
			+ '<p><strong>Let&#39;s start with what we mean when we say: </strong></p>'
			+ '<p><strong>Aggregate Information: </strong>Information that we combine into anonymous groups of customers or users. One way to think of it is in terms of a survey or opinion poll. Aggregate information would tell you that 80 percent of the people voted for a candidate, but not who actually voted. These groups are large enough to reasonably prevent individuals from being identified.</p>'
			+ '<p><strong>Anonymous Information: </strong>Information that doesn&#39;t directly identify and can&#39;t reasonably be used to identify an individual customer or user. </p>'
			+ '<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Anyone who purchases or uses our products or services. When a customer purchases retail products or services for use by others, like a family account, those family members also are customers.</p>'
			+ '<p><strong>Mobile Application: </strong>A software application that runs on smartphones, tablet computers or other mobile devices and that allows users to access a variety of services and information&#46;</p>'
			+ '<p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Information that directly identifies or reasonably can be used to figure out the identity of a customer or user, such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. Personal Information does not include published listing information.</p>'
			+ '<p><strong>Relevant Advertising:</strong> Uses aggregate information about groups of people (like age, ethnicity, income range, where those groups live and work, and their interests) to develop advertising that is more likely to be useful to that group. It does not use individual data about what a specific person might like. "Online behavioral advertising" is one type of relevant advertising. It uses interest categories based on the websites visited by groups of people to deliver advertising online.</p>'
			+ '<p><strong>User: </strong>Anyone who visits our websites or uses our mobile applications.</p>'
			+ '<p><strong>Website: </strong>And other terms like "Internet site," "site" and "web page" all mean the same thing, namely any page or location on the Internet, no matter what device (cell phone, tablet, laptop, PC, etc.) or protocol (http, WAP, ftp or other) is used to access the page or location.</p>'
			+ '<h3 id="scope"><strong>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THIS POLICY</strong></h3>'
			+ '<ol class="counting">'
			+ '<li><p class="number">What does this Policy cover?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />This Privacy Policy covers our practices regarding the information we collect about our customers and users (how we collect it and how we use it). Use of our products and services, as well as visits to our websites, are subject to this Privacy Policy.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Do you have any Privacy Policies other than this one?</p>'
						+ '<p><br />Yes. AT&#38;T companies that do not operate under our brand&#44; or certain co&#45;branded services&#44; may have separate privacy policies</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Some areas outside the United States require us to work a little differently&#46; In that case&#44; AT&#38;T may adopt separate privacy policies as necessary to reflect the requirements of applicable local laws, such as with our <a href="http://www.att.com.mx/" title="wireless operations in Mexico">wireless operations in Mexico</a>&#46; Satellite TV subscribers in certain U&#46;S&#46; Territories also may have separate privacy policies&#46; Satellite TV subscribers in certain U&#46;S&#46; Territories also may have separate privacy policies&#46;</p>'

Or, send it by e-mail to make sure they&#39;re on board. Hang it on the fridge. Up to you, just share it! </p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">When is information not covered by this Policy?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Any time you give information to companies other than AT&amp;T. Some examples are:</p>'
			+ '<ul class="bullet">'
			+ '<br /><li><p>When you use a non-AT&amp;T Wi-Fi service;</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>When you download applications or make purchases from other companies while using our Internet or wireless services;</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>When you go to a non-AT&amp;T website from one of our websites or applications (by clicking on a link or an advertisement, for example);</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>If you use public forums - such as social networking services, Internet bulletin boards, chat rooms, or blogs - the information is publicly available, and we cannot prevent distribution and use of that information by other parties;</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>Information about your location, usage and the numbers you dial when you&#39;re out and about and roaming on the network of another company;</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>When you purchase or use non-AT&amp;T products (such as wireless devices, internet browsers and mobile applications) in combination with AT&amp;T services;</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>When we license our brand to other companies for their use in marketing and selling certain non-AT&amp;T products and services, information you give those companies is not covered by this Policy.</p></li>'
			+ '</ul>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Can my information be covered by this policy and other privacy policies at the same time?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Yes, that can happen. For example:</p>'
			+ '<p>Sometimes we will provide a service with other companies. In that case your information may be subject to this Policy and that of the other companies. For example, if you use AT&amp;T High Speed Internet services "powered by" Yahoo! Inc., your information may be covered by both this Policy and the <a target="_blank" href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/sbc/details.html">Yahoo! Privacy Policy</a>.</p>'
			+ '<p><br />If you purchase one of our products or services from a retailer like Best Buy or Amazon.com, for example, any information you provide to them may be subject to both their policy and ours.</p>'
			+ '<p><br />If you connect to our Wi-Fi service through another network, such as one provided in a hotel, airport or other venue, any information collected from your use of that network could be subject to either the AT&amp;T policy or the venue policy, and sometimes both. The same thing applies if you connect to our network through your employer&#39;s corporate network, or any network operated by a non-AT&amp;T company.</p>'
			+ '<p><br />We think it&#39;s a great idea to take a look at the privacy policies of any companies you do business with to learn how they use your information.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">What about business customers?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />We may have written product or service agreements with our business customers that contain specific provisions about confidentiality&#44; security or handling of information&#46; When one of these agreements differs from or conflicts with this Policy&#44; the terms of those agreements will apply&#46;  This Policy does not apply to commercial satellite TV customers&#46;  In all other instances&#44; the terms of this Policy apply&#46;</p></li>'

			+ '<li><p class="number">Do you use my information to send me advertising?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Yes&#46; We may use information like the preferences you have expressed and interests you have demonstrated on our websites&#44; in our stores and through use of our products and services&#44; to provide you with marketing information and advertisements for AT&#38;T products and services&#46; Those ads may be delivered on our websites and mobile applications&#46; This is called &#34;first party&#34; advertising&#46; It is part of our service relationship and you are not able to opt&#45;out from this type of advertising&#46;</p>'
			+ '<p><br />We or our advertising partners may also use <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/privacy-policy?pid=24334" title="Cookies and Other Technologies">anonymous information gathered through cookies and similar technologies</a>, as well as other anonymous and aggregate information that either of us may have to help us tailor the ads you see on non-AT&amp;T sites. For example, if you see an ad from us on a non-AT&amp;T sports-related website, you may later receive an ad for sporting equipment delivered by us on a different website.  This is called "online behavioral advertising," which is a type of Relevant Advertising.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Do you use my information for other types of Relevant Advertising?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Yes. We may also use information we get through your use of our products and services, from our advertising partners, and information like your age and gender to deliver Relevant Advertising that is not online behavioral advertising. We combine your anonymous information with that of other users into aggregate "audience segments." These segments are based on particular interests and/or factual characteristics that everyone in that audience segment is likely to share. We might use that information to send you advertisements that are relevant to those interests or characteristics. </p>'
			+ '<p><br />We are careful to create Relevant Advertising with aggregate audience segments that are large enough that you can&#39;t be identified individually.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Do you use the location of my device for advertising purposes?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Yes. AT&amp;T uses information about the locations you visit in order to create combined wireless location interest characteristics that can be used to provide Relevant Advertising to you and others like you. </p>'
			+ '<p><br />Location characteristics are types of locations - like "movie theaters." People who live in a particular geographic area (a city, ZIP-code or ZIP+ 4 code, for example) might appear to have a high interest in movies, thanks to collective information that shows wireless devices from that area are often located in the vicinity of movie theaters. We might create a "movies characteristic" for that area, and deliver movie ads to the people who live there. </p>'
			+ '<p><br />We may associate your wireless device with a particular geographic area, such as a city, ZIP-code, or ZIP + 4 code, based on your billing address or the cell towers you connect with most frequently.</p>'
  			+ '<p><br />In addition to other privacy protections, the process we use to create our audience segment includes a requirement that the ZIP + 4 or other geographic area to which a wireless location is assigned must contain a minimum of 25 households. ZIP + 4 codes with less than 25 households are combined with other ZIP + 4 codes to satisfy this requirement.</p></li>'
  			+ '<li><p class="number">What&#39;s in it for me?</p>'
  			+ '<p><br />Just like the name says, you get advertising that&#39;s more relevant to your interests. For example, if a particular audience segment, like adults between the ages of 21 and 25 with a certain income range, has demonstrated a greater interest in movies than other segments, we might send them a movie ad for a movie geared toward young adults.This is just one way we deliver content that&#39;s more relevant.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">How do you use information about the programs I watch on TV to advertise to me&#63;</p>'
			+ '<p><br />We combine information about the shows that our customers are watching with their common interests to help us figure out what types of advertising they might be interested in seeing.</p>'
			+ '<p><br />It sometimes works like this: We look at the group of people watching a particular show. We identify common characteristics within that group. We use those characteristics to identify and deliver advertising that might be most relevant to watchers of that TV show. We might also deliver that same advertising during shows that appear to have similar audiences.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Do I ever have a chance to tell you what I&#39;m personally interested in&#63;</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Yes. With some programs offered or powered by AT&T you can sign up to receive text-message offers from businesses that are near your current location and match the interests you&#39;ve selected. You can change your mind at any time and stop participating in these programs.</p>'
 			+ '<p><br />When we add new offers like AT&amp;T Internet Preferences we&#39;ll let you know, so you can decide if you&#39;d like to participate. For example, we may offer you free or discounted services in exchange for the use of your Personal Information for advertising and other similar purposes. We promise, before we use any of your Personal Information (including information we gather as an Internet service provider) for such purposes, we will always give you the opportunity to make an informed choice about whether to participate</p></li>'
 			+ '<li><p class="number">What information do you provide to advertisers?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />AT&amp;T may provide reports to advertisers and other business customers about the success of its advertising campaigns. Those reports contain aggregate information about the number of times a particular ad was viewed, when it was viewed, whether it was viewed on a TV, a mobile device or a computer, demographics associated with the viewing audience and other similar information. Your anonymous information will not be included in aggregate reports about the success of Relevant Advertising campaigns if you have opted-out of Relevant Advertising delivered by AT&amp;T.</p></li>'

			+ '<h3 id="location"><strong>QUESTIONS ABOUT LOCATION INFORMATION</strong></h3>'
			+ '<ol class="counting">'
			+ '<li><p class="number">What is location information?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Exactly what it sounds like! It includes your ZIP-code and street address, as well as the whereabouts of your wireless device.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">How is it used?</p>'
			+ '<p><br />We use it in all kinds of ways, here are some examples:</p><br />'
			+ '<ul class="bullet">'
			+ '<li><p><strong>We Provide Wireless Voice and Data Services</strong>: We monitor, collect and use wireless location information, together with other information we get from our network and your wireless device, to maintain and improve our network. We also might use location information with your consent to provide you with a customized experience. For example, when you dial 411 Directory Assistance for a business telephone number, we might use your wireless location information to return the number of the business location closest to you.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p><strong>Location Based Services (LBS):</strong> Your device can be used to access a ton of services based on location. We offer these services via applications that have been pre-loaded or downloaded by you on your device. LBS also may be provided via text message or other functionality. We&rsquo;ll give you prior notice and ask for your consent when your location is used or shared. The form of consent may vary, but will be appropriate for the type of AT&amp;T LBS you use.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p><strong>LBS from other providers</strong>: With your consent (to us or the other company) we also may enable LBS from other companies by providing location information to their developers or location service providers.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>We use it for <strong><a href="http://www.att.com/gen/privacy-policy?pid=13692#tracking" title="Advertising">Advertising</a></strong>.</p></li></ul></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">How accurate is wireless location information? </p>'
			+ '<p><br />It depends on the technology we&#39;re using. For example, we can locate your device based on the cell tower that&#39;s serving you. The range could be up to 1,000 meters in any direction from the tower in urban areas, and up to 10,000 meters in rural areas. Wi-Fi networks provide more accurate location information, associating you with the place where the network is located - like a coffee shop - or to an area within or around that place.</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Services such as 411, 911, a "friend locator" application or a navigation/mapping application, require more precise information.  So for those we develop a more precise estimate of location by associating the serving cell tower ID with other information, like the latitude and longitude of the tower, radio frequency parameters, GPS information and timing differences in radio signals. Depending on a variety of factors, those methods may estimate the location of your device to within 30 to 1000 meters.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Are you the only ones who can locate my wireless device? </p>'
			+ '<p><br />Other companies may also be able to locate your device. For example, your handset manufacturer and your operating system provider may be able to locate your device. If you download mobile applications, those apps may be able to obtain your location directly from your handset or the operating system. Mobile applications that give you access to your employer&#39;s network may also give your employer the ability to locate your device.</p>'

This information doesn&#39;t include your Personal Information and is considered anonymous.</p>'
			+ '<p><br />When we collect information that identifies you personally, we may anonymize it for certain purposes. We remove data fields (such as name, address and telephone number) that can reasonably be used to identify you. We also use a variety of statistical techniques and operational controls to anonymize data. Anonymizing information is one of the tools we use to protect your privacy. </p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Tell me more about aggregate information.</p>'
			+ '<p><br />Aggregate information is a form of anonymous information.  We combine data that meet certain criteria into anonymous groups. For example, we might want to compare how customers in Beverly Hills, CA (or any city, county or ZIP-code) use their cell phones to how customers in Boulder, CO use their cell phones. In order to do that, we would combine customer data in each of the geographies into anonymous groups and look at all that aggregate data to understand how the two groups are different or similar.</p></li>'

			+ '<li><p>Reports that combine anonymous TV Viewing behaviors with other aggregate information we may have about our subscribers to create reports that would help a TV network better understand the audiences that are viewing their programs&#44; those that are not&#44; how frequently they watch&#44; when they watch and other similar information&#894; and</p></li>'
  			+ '<li><p>Reports for device manufacturers that combine information such as device type, make and model with demographic and regional location information to reflect the popularity of particular device types with various customer segments.</p></li></ul></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Do you provide companies with individual anonymous data as part of your External Marketing & Analytics Program?</p><br />'
			+ '<p>Yes&#46; For example&#44; we might share anonymous TV Viewing Information with media research companies that combine this data with other information to provide audience analysis services about what shows certain audience segments are watching&#46; When we provide individual anonymous information to businesses&#44; we require that they only use it to compile aggregate reports&#44; and for no other purpose&#46; We also require businesses to agree they will not attempt to identify any person using this information&#44; and that they will handle it in a secure manner&#44; consistent with this Policy&#46; </p></li>'
			+ '<li><p class="number">Do you use my anonymous information in other types of external reports?</p><br />'
			+ '<p>Yes, we may use your anonymous information to provide Metrics Reports to our business customers and service suppliers. These reports are considered part of the underlying service and we do not sell them to other customers or suppliers.</p>'
			+ '<p>For example, if you connect to our Wi-Fi service in a hotel, airport or other venue you should know the operator of that venue is our business customer, and that we will provide that operator with Metrics Reports about usage of and communications with the Wi-Fi network in their location. Those reports contain statistical information like:</p><br />'
			+ '<ul class="bullet">'
			+ '<li><p>The number of devices connecting to the Wi-Fi network, duration of Wi-Fi sessions and the amount of bandwidth used during those sessions; and</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p>Foot-traffic data, including the numbers of devices inside and outside the store at a given time; the number of new and frequent visitors; where visitors are located within the store (e.g., specific departments or other locations within the venue) and frequency of visits and time spent within the store.</p></li>'
			+ '<li><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When your wireless device is turned on, it regularly sends out signals that enable it to connect to cell towers, Wi-Fi access points or other technologies so that we (and others) are able to provide you with services. These signals can be used to determine your device location. You can turn Wi-Fi to the "off" position on the "settings" feature of your device to prevent the collection of these signals by Wi-Fi equipment in retail stores and other public places.</p></li></ul>'
			+ '<p>Another example&#44; we also license video programming from content providers&#46; As part of our agreement&#44; we provide them with Metrics Reports&#46; These reports contain combined measurements and statistical information related to the number of TV subscribers who watched or accessed a particular program at a particular time and other similar measurements&#46;</p></li>'

			+'<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is AT&#38;T&#8217;s Privacy Policy different than DIRECTV&#8217;s&#63;<br />'
			+'<p><strong>A.</strong> The AT&#38;T Privacy Policy gives you an additional choice about how we use of your anonymous and aggregate information&#44; for something we call &#8220;External Marketing &#38; Analytics Reports&#46;&#8221; It also uses the term &#8220;Relevant Advertising&#8221; when describing advertising sent to audiences with common interests and characteristics&#46;</p> '
			+'<p><strong>Q.</strong> If I had previously chosen not to receive DIRECTV&#8217;s satellite TV advertising that is selected for me  based on information about me&#44; will AT&#38;T honor my choice going forward&#63;<br />'
			+'<p><strong>A.</strong>  Yes&#46; AT&#38;T calls that Relevant Advertising&#44; and we will continue to honor your previous choice going forward&#46;</p>'
			+'<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What is your policy on limiting AT&amp;T marketing materials sent by U.S. mail?<br />'
			+'<p><strong>A.</strong>  Customers can unsubscribe from AT&amp;T marketing materials sent by U.S. mail <a href="/gen/privacy-policy?pid=22975" title="Residential Do Not Mail (DNM) Statement">here.</a></p> '
			+'<p><strong>Q.</strong>  I have an AT&amp;T business account. Will my anonymous information be used in External Marketing &amp; Analytics Reports?</p>'
			+'<p><strong>A.</strong>  These reports will use anonymous information from AT&amp;T consumer accounts. Business accounts are not included except for small-business U-verse accounts. However, they can opt out just like consumer accounts by visiting <a href="http://www.att.com/cmpchoice" title="Opt Out">www.att.com/cmpchoice</a>.</p>'
			+'<p><strong>Q.</strong>  For AT&amp;T Relevant Advertising, why do I have to opt out from each computer or mobile device?</p>'
			+'<p><strong>A.</strong> That&#39;s a good question. Opt-out works differently for your computer than for your mobile device.  On your computer&#39;s web browser, opt-out works through a small data file called a "cookie." The cookie communicates from your browser, telling advertisers that you don&#39;t want to receive the relevant ad. It is anonymous, and is not linked to your identity or account. This is the current, standard method for online advertising. You can learn more about cookies <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/privacy-policy?pid=24334" title="Cookies and Other Technology">here</a>, and you can opt-out your computer&#39;s browser at <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?&type=att&pid=ATT_Publisher" title="AT&amp;T - Advertising Preferences" target="_blank">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?&type=att&pid=ATT_Publisher</a> if you are on that computer now.</p>'
			+'<p>For mobile, different devices use different technologies. Some mobile devices, for example, do not support the use of cookies.  Therefore, to ensure that we don&#39;t deliver AT&amp;T Relevant Advertising to your mobile device, we must be able to accurately identify the device that you are opting out. To do that, on each device that you wish to opt-out, go to <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?&type=att&pid=ATT_Publisher" title="AT&amp;T - Mobile Opt Out" target="_blank">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?&type=att&pid=ATT_Publisher</a>  and click "Opt-Out". Please make sure you are connected to the AT&amp;T cellular network when you do so.</p>'
			+'<p><strong>Q.</strong> I can&#39;t figure out how to opt out of the External Marketing &amp; Analytics Reports.</p>'
			+'<p><strong>A.</strong> You can opt out of External Marketing &amp; Analytics reports in two ways. You can go to <a href="http://att.com/cmpchoice" title="Opt Out">http://att.com/cmpchoice</a> with your account ID and password, or you can call 866.344.9850. If you have more than one AT&amp;T account, such as wireless and AT&amp;T U-verse, you may have to log in to each account if you use <a href="http://att.com/cmpchoice" title="Opt Out">att.com/cmpchoice</a>.

CBC/Radio-Canada Content Submission Guidelines for CBC/Radio-Canada Owned or Controlled Platforms (Content Submission Guidelines)
Everyone, every way.  All CBC/Radio-Canada platforms are open to people of every age, race, religion, sex, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.
We want your perspective. Probe, analyze, inform. Challenge, advocate, debate. Inspire, entertain, enjoy. Your contributions make our programming richer, the conversations more lively and diverse.
Tell us your story, be a part of the conversation. CBC/Radio-Canada wants you to participate in sharing  the content you create/upload (Your Content) with us on all of our platforms. Your Content includes but is not limited to online comments, video uploads and photo submissions.
We want your engaging photos and videos that capture breaking news and/or compelling stories. In addition, we regularly solicit Your Content on various topics for programs and stories, blogs, contests and many other types of interactive engagement.
CBC: Your username links to your profile and will appear alongside any of 'Your Content'.  We reserve the right to identify your real name and city of residence from your profile when using Your Content (ie. John Doe from Vancouver says...).  Adopting the identity of another person with the intention to mislead or cause harm is a serious violation which may lead to expulsion of the user.
By submitting Your Content, you grant us the non-exclusive right to use your content royalty-free, in perpetuity. Your Content may be published on CBC/Radio-Canada owned or controlled platforms, and may even be included in our stories.  CBC/Radio-Canada cannot guarantee that Your Content will be published. We may also edit Your Content for length, size or clarity.  Your Content may be indexed by Internet search engines.  CBC/Radio-Canada has no obligation to remove Your Content from its platforms even if you make a request.   You should think carefully about your intent and the consequence of publication of any of Your Content.  For more information, see our full Terms of Use.
When you share Your Content with us:

Keep Your Content relevant to the topic and avoid repetitive posting.
Be respectful and courteous, as if you were having a face-to-face discussion.
If you are writing about legal issues, remember that people are innocent until proven guilty (that may mean using words such as "allegedly").
Feel free to link internally within the CBC.ca/Radio-Canada.ca site as many times as you would like. As for external web addresses, we allow no more than three links per post.  CBC/Radio-Canada does not endorse the content of	external web sites and has no liability as to their content in any event. CBC/Radio-Canada reserves its right to take-down any external link.
Radio-Canada: Use French for all of your exchanges and comments.  Other languages cannot be used except for an occasional word.

We want to hear your own opinion. Your Content must be created and owned by you, including any music and artwork.  Breaking copyright rules is not permitted (that includes copying and pasting excerpts from other sites without permission and attribution). If the majority of Your Content was written or created by someone else, even with a proper credit, it won’t be accepted.

Be sensitive in 'Your Content' regarding the death or injury of private individual, especially children.
Make it personal, not commercial by leaving out press releases and commercial promotions.

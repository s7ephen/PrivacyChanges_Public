<h2>Terms of Service</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to AddThis.com (the "Site"), a website operated by AddThis, Inc. ("AddThis", "we", "us", or "our"). We operate the AddThis sharing platform, which makes sharing content on the web easy (the "<b>AddThis Platform</b>"). If you are reading this agreement, you are probably familiar with our buttons, menus and toolboxes (collectively, the "<b>AddThis Buttons</b>") that allow visitors of participating websites to share content through email, social networking websites, blogs and more. Or you may be using one of our AddThis toolbars or other tools that allow you, an End User, to share content from virtually any website (collectively "Toolbars"). This Site provides resources and information about the AddThis Platform and a number of related services (collectively, including the Site and the AddThis Platform, the "<b>Services</b>"). The following terms and conditions (the "<b>Terms of Use</b>") form a binding agreement between you and us whether you are a visitor to this Site (a "<b>Visitor</b>"), an individual who is accessing and using the AddThis Platform from a Publisher website (an "<b>End User</b>") or the owner or operator of a website that makes the AddThis Buttons available on its website (a "<b>Publisher</b>" and the website a "<b>Publisher Site</b>"). Unless otherwise indicated, "<b>you</b>" means Visitors, End Users and Publishers.
</p>
<p>
	PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING THE SITE AND USING THE SERVICES YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE SITE OR USING THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY OR BUSINESS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY OR BUSINESS TO THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU OR THE ENTITY DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS SITE OR THE SERVICES.
</p>
<p>
	<b>1. SERVICES</b>. The AddThis Platform provides online sharing services that make sharing Content easy. When we refer to <b>Content</b> we mean web pages, text, videos, images, audio clips, photos, graphics, advertisements, sponsorships and/or other types of content or data. The AddThis Platform is designed to maximize distribution of Publisher Content, drive traffic back to the Publisher Site, and provide you insight into End Users who share your Publisher Content.
</p>
<p>
	<b>2. PUBLISHER ACCOUNTS</b>. If you are a Publisher and want to receive reports or other customized Services that are related to your Publisher Site(s), we may require that you create an <b>Account</b>. You can create an Account by following the registration instructions provided on the Site. If you choose to create an Account, you agree to provide only true, current, accurate, and complete registration information, and you will keep that information true, accurate, and up-to-date. If you have requested a fee-bearing Service, you agree also to provide payment information. Each registration is for your personal use, or for the use by the company or organization on whose behalf you access the Site and use the Service. You are responsible for all activities occurring under Your Account, including payment of applicable fees, and you may not authorize anyone else's use. You must abide by all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations in connection with your use of the Services, including those related to data privacy, international communications and the transmission of technical or personal data. You may not use your Account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others.
</p>
<p>
	<b>3. CONTENT</b>. Publishers are responsible for any Content on the Publisher Site and End Users are responsible for any Content submitted by the End User (e.g., comments on any interactive forum or in any cover email associated with a share). You agree that any Content for which you are responsible will not:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Infringe the copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property or proprietary right of others</li>
	<li>Violate the privacy, publicity, or other rights of third parties</li>
	<li>Be false or inaccurate or become false or inaccurate at any time</li>
	<li>Be discriminatory, unlawful, tortious, obscene, fraudulent, defamatory, harmful, threatening, pornographic, indecent, vulgar, harassing, discourteous, hateful, abusive or racially, ethnically, religiously, sexually or otherwise offensive, as determined by us in our sole discretion</li>
	<li>Disclose or provide information protected under any law, agreement or fiduciary relationship, including but not limited to proprietary or confidential information of others</li>
	<li>Misrepresent the source of the Content</li>
	<li>Contain any virus, Trojan horse, worm, time bomb, cancelbot, or other disabling device or other harmful component intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information</li>
	<li>Advocate or encourage any illegal activity; or</li>
	<li>Have the potential to create liability for us or cause us to violate the requirements of or to lose the services, in whole or in part, of our Internet service providers or other suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p>		
	As a Publisher, you can download code from the Site that allows you to associate or "tag" a webpage or a particular piece of Content on your Publisher Site with one of our AddThis Buttons ("<b>Publisher Content</b>"). This "tagging", which enables your website visitors to automatically and easily promote, create links, and copy or paste Content from your Publisher Site, is designed to maximize distribution of Publisher Content, drive traffic back to your Publisher Site, and provide Publishers insight into End Users who share Publisher Content. When you tag Content as Publisher Content, you authorize us to use, reproduce, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform the Publisher Content to the extent necessary or desired for us to provide the Services. If you are an End User, you similarly, authorize us to use, reproduce, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform the Content you provide or submit by using the Service.
</p>		
<p>
	We do not endorse any Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed in any Content, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with any Content. We may decide whether any Content is inappropriate or not in compliance with these Terms of Use and reserve the right to remove Content and/or suspend or terminate your use of the Services at any time, without prior notice and in our sole discretion. Sharing of certain kinds of content may be prohibited by other services (e.g. Facebook'sterms prohibit sharing of advertising using Facebook's social plug-ins). Please comply with the rules for services that you share to or share from.
</p>

<p>
	<b>10. DATA RIGHTS AND PUBLISHER PRIVACY POLICIES</b>. We do not charge End Users or Publishers a fee for using the Services, including the AddThis Platform. In consideration for the Services, you agree that we may collect data related to an End User's use of the Services including an End User's sharing of Publisher Content (collectively, the "<b>Data</b>"). Our data collection, use and disclosure practices are described more fully in our Privacy Policy and include the use of log information and cookies that record anonymous (i.e., non-personal) information about End Users. When an End User downloads a page that contains an AddThis Button, we may deploy a cookie on our own behalf or on behalf of our data partners, to record information about how an End User uses the web, such as the web search that landed the End User on a particular page or categories of the End User's interests. We may use the Data to target advertising toward the End User or authorize others to do the same. You may not enable AddThis to collect Data from Sites that are directed to children pursuant to the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If you are a Publisher and prefer that we do not collect, and do not assist others in the collection of, Data about End Users on your Publisher Site, you may <a href="mailto:support@addthis.com">email</a> us and we will respond in a reasonable time in order to assist you in discontinuing our placement of cookies related to your Publisher Site. Please be advised, however, that if you cause us to discontinue the placement of cookies related to your Publisher Site, we will not be able to provide you with certain Services. For example, we won't be able to provide you reports and analytics regarding the usage and effectiveness of the AddThis Platform on your Publisher Site. If you do not cause us to discontinue the placement of our cookies, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide and irrevocable right and license to collect, use and disclose the Data as provided in our <a href="/privacy/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and to allow our third party data partners to do the same.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Important Notification Requirement for Publishers Sites</b>: We are concerned about the privacy of End Users and want to provide them choice regarding the use of their information. AddThis supports the Self Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and is a member of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (NAI). Accordingly, we require that your Publisher Sites have a notice with language substantially similar to the following:
</p>
<p>
	<em>"We allow third-party companies, including AddThis, to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>."</em>
</p>
</p>
	<b>Important Notification Requirement for Publishers Sites directed at End Users located in the European Union</b>: We are concerned about the privacy of End Users and want to provide them choice regarding the use of their information. AddThis supports the Self Regulatory Framework for Online Behavioral Advertising created by the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA). Accordingly, we require that your Publisher Sites that are directed to End Users located in the EU have a notice with language substantially similar to the following:
</p>
<p>
	<em>"We allow third-party companies, including AddThis, to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website.

</p>
<p>
	<b>11. PRIVACY</b>. We know that your privacy and the security of your information is important. For this reason, we have created a Privacy Policy that describes our collection, use and disclosure of information. You may not enable AddThis to collect Data from Sites that are directed to children pursuant to the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
</p>
<p>
	<b>12. GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS</b>.

</p>
<p>
	<b>13. MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS</b>. We may change the terms of these Terms of Use from time to time on a going-forward basis. We will notify you of any such material changes by posting notice of the changes on the Site, and/or, in our sole discretion, by email.

YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SITE OR SERVICES.
</p>

1. General Statement:
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This privacy statement explains our policies and practices regarding online customer information. It is through this disclosure that we intend to provide you with a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use, and safeguard personal and other information we collect or that you provide through this website, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. It is our sincere hope that by explaining our data handling practices we will develop a trusting and long-lasting relationship with you. By using the site, you agree to the terms of this privacy statement. For information regarding the data that Vehicle Health Report and SYNC Services (where equipped) collect from you to provide you with these services, see Terms and Conditions
.


2. Information About Our Organization and Website and General Data Collection Practices
This Privacy Statement applies to www.Ford.com and its related mobile site, and to www.Owner.Ford.com (collectively referenced herein as “site” or “website”) which are owned by Ford Motor Company, Marketing, Sales and Service Division, 16800 Executive Plaza Drive, Dearborn, MI 48126. Ford.com also contains certain micro-sites which may be administered by a third-party on behalf of Ford such as warriorsinpink.com.
Ford.com
The business purpose of the Ford.com website is to provide visitors: (1) with knowledge of the features and benefits of the complete line of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks; (2) with purchasing-related information such as available incentives, services, product inventory and dealership contacts; (3) the ability to save and share certain content that is of interest to you such as your favorite vehicles, technologies, and photos and videos; (4) the opportunity to enter sweepstakes and purchase items; and (5) the opportunity to share your story regarding a Ford Motor Company product.
On certain portions on Ford.com, you may have the opportunity to request information or a contact from your local dealer through various shopping tools. These shopping tools include Build and Price, Search Dealer Inventory, Incentives and Offers, Request a Local Quote, and Trade-in Value. When you provide your personally identifiable information in those instances, it is collected by FordDirect, an independent company that assists our dealers. If you choose to provide your personally identifiable information to FordDirect, please note that it will be subject to the FordDirect Privacy Policy located at http://www.forddirectprivacy.com/
.
Certain features that are available on www.ford.com may not be available on the related mobile site and vice versa.
Owner.Ford.com
The business purpose of Owner.Ford.com is to provide Ford and Mercury vehicle owners a web destination that aggregates resources for convenience, savings, and vehicle maintenance. Owner.Ford.com provides access to vehicle and dealer information, discounts, coupons, service rebates, service history tracking, and SYNC product information, including SYNC software and support documentation. Also, where applicable, this site provides owners the ability to manage your SYNC Services and Vehicle Health Report accounts including setting various preferences, track Owner Advantage Rewards account(s), and access Ford Extended Service Plan information and purchase processing. 
For added convenience, a select set of site features are accessible from web-enabled mobile devices as a mobile-optimized web experience. These site features may be limited in functionality.
Online Tracking Information
When you visit this site, other parties such as third-party advertising partners and analytics providers may collect information about your online activity over time and across websites. This information may include identifiers that may permit those parties to serve tailored ads to your device. For more information about third-party advertising partners’ collection and use of such data for interest-based advertising purposes (and opting out of such use), see “Interest-Based Online/Behavioral Advertising” below.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals other than cookies, Ford Motor Company does not currently respond to undefined “DNT” signals to its US websites.
Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some functions or services on our sites.
See Sections 5 and 7 for more information.


3. Personally Identifiable Information We Collect From You:
When you visit this site we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, ““personally identifiable information” is information that identifies you as an individual, for example your name, street address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card number. If you opt not to provide us with personally identifiable information you can still access our website, however you will be unable to participate in certain promotions, such as sweepstakes, create login credentials in order to use certain functionalities on the site, activate or use a service, have a purchase order fulfilled or receive product information, or on the Owner.Ford.com site initiate a text message containing the name, address and telephone number of a dealer.
Ford.com - Saving Content
Some functionality and services we provide you offer the opportunity to save certain content two ways. You can save it anonymously (in that instance, content will be associated with your computer by placing a session or persistent cookie on it), or by creating login credentials described in the next paragraph.
Ford.com - Creating Login Credentials
Certain pages of this website may allow you to create login credentials by typing in your user name/ID or email address and password and other information, or by using one of the available social media authentication methods such as Facebook, Google +, and Yahoo.

By authenticating through one of the social media options, you allow us to receive your information that is accessible. We encourage you to review the privacy policy and any terms and conditions, for the method you choose to utilize for authentication.

5. Other (Non-Personally Identifiable) Information We Collect From Site Visitors:
This site collects other “non-personally identifiable information” from site visitors. This means that we do not track these items on an individual basis that identifies the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all site visitors. Non-personally identifiable information may include information such as tracking the site pages that are visited, the amount of time spent on our site, clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, page views, events (which shopping tools you interacted with), and zip code. This includes aggregate data provided by a third-party that surveys site visitors on our behalf.
Third-Party analytics provider ClickTale also records sessions. This only occurs on areas of the website that do not collect personally identifiable information. The data provided to Ford is anonymized and it does not contain the IP address. Website visitors may opt-out of ClickTale by going to http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html
. For more information on ClickTale’s privacy practices go to http://www.clicktale.com/privacy-service
.
If you visit a related mobile site or are directed to this site via a QR Code that you scanned, we collect additional non-personally identifiable information which may include the type/model of the mobile device viewing the site and the mobile device’s service provider and operating system.
If your mobile phone has the capability and the GPS feature on the mobile phone is turned on, you can utilize certain locator functionalities on the site which may utilize your GPS data to determine your location in order to fulfill your request. 
Our primary goal in collecting non-personally identifiable information from you is to be able to perform site metrics that allow us to improve the functionality of the website.
We may use session and persistent “cookies,” session logs, spot light ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags, banner ads or links, third-party networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., a third party email service provider for Tell-a-Friend user-customized emails), and third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Adobe, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and ClickTale; these companies may also use such tools) to collect aggregate or other non-personally identifiable information about site visitors. An explanation on collection methods and how they work is included in Section 7 - Methods to Collect Information, below.


6. How We Use the Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect:
Non-Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be used to:

Compile aggregate and statistical data to help in website design and to identify popular features
Measure site activity to allow us to update our site to better meet user wants and needs
Make the user experience more customer friendly

This site utilizes non-personally identifiable information for the purpose of performing analytics on the users' experience while visiting this site. This analysis:

Is performed on an aggregate level and does not identify you or your information personally
May involve the use of a third-party vendor acting on behalf of this site
Is performed in order to improve our website and the user experience
May include the use of session and/or persistent cookies to track user movement across this and other Ford Motor Company websites or to track other events within or across this and other Ford Motor Company websites 



7. Methods to Collect Information and Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising:
A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.
A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.
A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.
This site may use a third party to activate and/or deliver a service, or deliver site functionality such as fulfilling your request to purchase a product or service, including items from our online store. In performing this function the third party may place a persistent cookie on your computer or have to gather personal information from you in order to activate and deliver the service, or facilitate the processing of your purchase.
This site may use a third-party click tracking analytics tool (such as Adobe, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and ClickTale) to capture clickthrough statistics.
This site may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.
This website may generate a “session log” when you visit our site. We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.
Users you may be provided the opportunity to integrate with third-party social media sites, and this site may track on an aggregate level the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.
Users may be directed to this site via banner ads, site links or QR Codes. Ads, site links or QR Codes may use tools such as cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personally identifiable information from the user.
Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising
 Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising.
On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you visit other (non-Ford) sites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.” 
Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices on the page.
 Opting out (site pages).
If you do not want your browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s). Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this privacy statement.
 Opting out (advertisements).
Advertisements on third-party sites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy statement may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.
 Opt-out Compliance Service.
This site and advertisements on third-party sites that link to this privacy statement use the Evidon assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) ( http://www.aboutads.info
). When you opt-out on site pages or through such advertisements, Evidon conveys your opt-out election(s) to the applicable advertising partner(s), which then know to place a cookie on your specific computer and browser (and only the specific computer and browser from which you opt out) indicating that you have opted out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again. The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time. To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

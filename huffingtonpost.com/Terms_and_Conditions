                you agree that you will not:
                (I) submit material that is copyrighted, 
                protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, 
                including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have

                rights granted herein; (II) publish falsehoods or 
                misrepresentations that could damage us or any third party;

                use of or reliance on any content, goods or services available on or through such services.
9. We May be Legally Compelled to Disclose Certain Information: You agree that in 
                the event we receive a subpoena issued by a court or from a law enforcement or government 
                agency, we shall comply with such subpoenas without your consent or prior notice to you 
                and may disclose your IP address, username, name, IP location or other information 
                in response thereto.
10. Our Liability to You is Limited: The Huffington Post and its affiliates, 
                and their respective members, directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, 
                agents and licensors are not liable for incidental, indirect, consequential, special, 
                punitive, or exemplary damages of any kind, including, without limitation, lost revenues 
                or profits, loss of business or loss of data, in any way related to this site or for 
                any claim, loss or injury based on errors, omissions, interruptions or other

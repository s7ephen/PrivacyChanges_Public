	<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Myspace LLC ("<strong>Myspace</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>") operates Myspace®, a place where people come to connect, discover, and share. Showcasing artists and their work, Myspace gives people access to a massive digital music library.  With roots in music and social, the platform is built to empower all artists—from musicians and designers to writers and photographers—helping them connect with audiences, collaborators, and partners to achieve their goals.  Through an open design, compelling editorial features, and analytics-based recommendations, Myspace fosters a creative community of people who connect around mutual affinity and inspiration for the purpose of shaping, sharing, and discovering what’s next.</p>
	
	<p>The services offered by Myspace include (i) those offered on any Myspace-branded URL, including <a href="https://www.myspace.com" target="_blank" name="www.myspace.com" onclick="MySpace.CMS.track('8561b574-d2db-4344-8eb5-0da321c5e99f','139264')">www.myspace.com</a> (the “<strong>Myspace Website</strong>”), (ii) Myspace messaging services (including, without limitation, instant messaging, private messaging, and public and private group chatting), (iii) Myspace music and video services (including, without limitation, any Myspace TV-branded video service (“<strong>Myspace TV™</strong>”)), (iv) Myspace developer services, (v) Myspace mobile services, (vi) Myspace advertising services, and (vii) any other features, content, or applications offered or operated from time to time by Myspace in connection with Myspace’s business, including when Myspace is accessed via the internet, mobile device, television or other device (collectively, “<strong>Myspace Services</strong>”).  The Myspace Services are hosted in the United States.  As part of your use of the Myspace Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the United States.  <strong>If you do not agree to this international transfer of data, then you must refrain from using the Myspace Services.</strong></p>
	
	<p>The Myspace Services are operated by Myspace LLC, a company with a mailing address at 8391 Beverly Blvd., #349, Los Angeles, CA 90048. Myspace LLC is owned by Viant Technology Inc. ("<strong>VIANT</strong>"), a digital media company.</p>
	
	<p>This Agreement constitutes legally binding terms and applies to such use of the Myspace Services regardless of the type of device used to access them ("<strong>Device</strong>") unless such services post a different terms of use or end user license agreement, in which case that agreement ("<strong>Other Terms</strong>") shall instead govern.  By accessing and/or using any of the Myspace Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement (or if applicable, the Other Terms), whether you are a "<strong>Visitor</strong>" (which means that you simply browse the Myspace Services, including, without limitation, through a mobile or other wireless Device, or otherwise use the Myspace Services without being registered) or you are a "<strong>Member</strong>" (which means that you have registered with Myspace).  The term "<strong>User</strong>" refers to a Visitor or a Member.  You are authorized to use the Myspace Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) only if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations ("<strong>Applicable Law</strong>") and the terms of this Agreement.  In addition, in consideration for becoming a Member and/or making use of the Myspace Services, you must indicate your acceptance of this Agreement during the registration process.  Thereafter, you may create your account (your "<strong>Account</strong>"), and its associated profile(s) (each a "<strong>Profile</strong>") in accordance with the terms herein.</p>
	
	<p>Your continued use of the Myspace Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by and your acceptance of the terms and conditions posted at such time, and will be a new agreement between us applicable to such new use or transaction.  It is therefore important that you review this Agreement (and any applicable Additional Terms) regularly.  If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement (or any applicable Other Terms or Additional Terms) and to abide by all Applicable Law (defined below), you are not authorized to use the applicable Myspace Services and should discontinue use.</p>

	<p>In some instances, both this Agreement and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of service or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Myspace Services or to a service or product offered via the Myspace Services (in each such instance, and collectively, "<strong>Additional Terms</strong>").  To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.  Please also review the terms of the Myspace Services' <a href="privacy" target="_blank" name="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="videoprivacy" target="_blank" name="Privacy Policy">Video Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="/pages/cookiepolicy" target="_blank" name="Cookie Policy">Cookie Policy</a>, which you accept by using the Myspace Services.</p>

		<!-- 1. -->
		<li>
			<span>Eligibility</span>
			<p><span>Use of the Myspace Services and registration to be a Member for the Myspace Services ("<strong>Membership</strong>") is void where prohibited and subject to compliance with Applicable Law, this Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms.  By using the Myspace Services, you represent and warrant that (a) other than as authorized in the Non-Standard Profile terms in <a href="#9." name="Profiles and Profile Settings">Section 9</a>  below, all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 13 years of age or older, and if you are not of the age of majority where you reside, you will only use the Myspace Services with parental or legal guardian consent (following their review of this Agreement); and (d) your use of the Myspace Services does not violate any Applicable Law.  You may not create an Account for anyone other than yourself without the other person's permission.  Your Account will be deleted and your Membership may be terminated without warning, if we believe that you have misrepresented your age or identity to us in a manner that violates this Agreement or is unlawful.

		<a id="2." name="Term, Terms and Termination"></a>
		<!-- 2. -->
		<li>
			<span>Term, Terms and Termination</span>
			<p><span>This Agreement (or if applicable, Other Agreement and/or Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable Myspace Services to which it applies, shall govern such use of such Myspace Services (including transactions entered during such use).  As our site and services evolve, the terms and conditions under which we offer Myspace Services may prospectively be modified and we may cease offering the Myspace Services under the Agreement or Additional Terms for which they were previously offered.  Accordingly, each time you sign in to or otherwise use the Myspace Services you are entering into a new agreement with us on the then applicable terms and conditions and you agree that we may notify you of Other Terms by posting them on the applicable Myspace Services (or in any other reasonable manner of notice which we elect), and that your use of such Myspace Services after such notice constitutes your going forward agreement to the Other Terms for your new use and transactions.  Therefore, you should review the posted Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Myspace Services (at least prior to each transaction or submission).  The Other Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.  However, the Agreement (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Myspace Services will continue to apply to such prior use (<strong><em>i.e.</em></strong>, changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You should frequently check the Myspace Website, any Messages sent from Myspace to you on the Myspace Services, and the e-mail you associated with your Account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice.  You can reject any new, revised or additional terms by discontinuing use of the Myspace Services.</span></p>
			
			<p><span>You may terminate your Membership at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in your Profile Settings (discussed further in <a href="#9." name="Profiles and Profile Settings">Section 9</a>).

Orders are accepted by us only upon delivery by us of the product or services. We may change terms and conditions of offers from time to time and may refuse or cancel orders; provided, however, that if we have charged you prior to rejecting an order we will issue a refund.  We try to accurately describe our products and services, and their pricing, but typos and other errors may occur so we do not warrant that specifications, pricing or other Myspace Content or Myspace Services will be complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate.  We will make good faith efforts to post corrections when such mistakes of a material nature are discovered and we will provide you with suitable means to allow you to correct any input errors you make before you make a payment for the Myspace Services.  If Myspace terminates your Membership because you have breached the Agreement, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any unused portion of fees or payments (if any).  If you terminate your Membership, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any unused portion of fees or payments (if any).  If Myspace terminates your Membership, or any ongoing Myspace Services for which you have paid, other than for your breach of the Agreement (or of applicable Additional Terms), then as your sole remedy, Myspace shall provide a pro-rata refund of any fees or payments (if any) for Myspace Services that you paid for but that were not yet delivered.  Myspace may require that you agree to certain Additional Terms for some Myspace Services, such as related to fee-based portions of the Myspace Services (e.g., fees to access certain content from your mobile, tablet or internet connected television or other Device).  We may offer customer support services from time to time, but are not obligated to do so.

		<!-- 9. -->
		<li>
			<span>Profiles and Profile Settings</span>
			<p><span>Myspace may allow you to create multiple Profiles associated with your Account on certain aspects of, or all of the Myspace Services.  Examples of such Profiles are "Real Name Profiles", "Alias Profiles", "Parody Profiles", "Role Playing Profiles", "Fan Profiles", "Artist Profiles", or other Profiles that Myspace may authorize from time to time.  We may offer you, from time to time, the ability to choose how you share or make your Profile, or aspects of it, available to others by means of "<strong>Profile Settings</strong>", which functionality may change as the Myspace Services evolve.  Myspace currently makes all Profiles of Members aged 18 and older public by default.  Profiles of Members whose ages are 13 to 17 are currently "restricted" by default, as further detailed in the <a href="privacy" target="_blank" name="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>.  You may adjust the public or restricted status of your Profile in your Profile Settings.  We will make good faith efforts to honor Profile Settings, but are not responsible for errors and reserve the right to change the way Settings and preferences work from time to time, so visit your Profile Settings regularly to ensure that the reflect your preferences and to see how we may have added or changed how you can exercise choice.  For more information on how to use Profile Settings, and how they are intended to work, click <a href="/settings/profile" target="_blank" name="Profile settings">here</a>. You may not use any Profile for purpose of impersonation, deception or confusion.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<!-- 9.1. -->
				<li><strong>Real Name Profiles</strong>.  You may create a Profile in which your activities on the Myspace Services are associated with your real name (each, a "<strong>Real Name Profile</strong>"), and you agree and acknowledge that any risk associated with such Real Name Profiles are borne solely by you.
				</li>
				<!-- 9.2. -->
				<li><strong>Alias Profiles</strong>.  An Alias Profile allows you to create an alternate public-facing profile as an alternative to a Real Name Profile, which publicly displays your real name in association with your Profile and activities on the Myspace Services.  For example, you might decide that in an Alias Profile, your username or full name for that Profile is a nickname or other made up name. 
				</li>
				<!-- 9.3. -->
				<li><strong>Parody, Role Playing and Fan Profiles</strong>.  Myspace may allow you to create profiles for the purpose of parody, role playing, or being a fan (collectively, Parody, Role Playing and Fan Profiles are known as "<strong>Non-Standard Profiles</strong>").  You are allowed to create Non-Standard Profiles, but you must indicate in the Non-Standard Profile that Non-Standard Profile will be used for the Non-Standard Profile purposes, by including a statement of this fact in the about section of your Profile (e.g., "This is a parody Profile.", or similar language). You must also ensure that the full name that you choose for the Non-Standard Profile includes some indication that the Non-Standard Profile is being used in a parody, role-playing, fan or other manner than as a true and veritable Account of an actual living person.  For example, if you want to create a Non-Standard Profile for the purpose of (i) role playing, you should add "-roleplay" to the end of the desired full name; (ii) fanning, you should add "-fan" to the end of the desired full name; (iii) parody or farce, you should add "-fake", "-parody", or "-joke" to the end of the desired full name.  You must not use a Non-Standard Profile for purposes of impersonation, deception or confusion.
				</li>
				<!-- 9.4. -->
				<li><strong>Artist Profiles</strong>.  Myspace may allow you to create a Profile specifically designed for artists (each an "<strong>Artist Profile</strong>"), for example, musicians, comedians, or other artists.  Myspace may provide Artist Profiles with features and functionality not available to other Profile types, and you must not use an Artist Profile if you are not legitimately an artist.
				</li>
				<!-- 9.5. -->
				<li><strong>Suspension or Termination</strong>.  Myspace may suspend or terminate Profiles, and/or the Membership of Accounts associated with them, in the event they do not comply with this Agreement, or for any other or no reason.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span>Individuals and artists that are Members may set up profiles, subject to certain rules.  From time to time we may offer certain functionality to allow you to express privacy, communication and other preferences, which we will make a good faith effort to honor.</span></p>

					<ol>
						<!-- 17.1.1. -->
						<li>
							<p><span><strong>First - Try to Resolve</strong>.  If you or Myspace becomes aware of a Dispute, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.  Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 17.1.1.  Your notice to us must be sent to:  Myspace LLC, 8391 Beverly Blvd., #349, Los Angeles, CA 90048, Attn: Business &amp; Legal Affairs.  For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Myspace and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Myspace to resolve the Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Myspace, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable. </span></p>
						</li>
						<!-- 17.1.2. -->
						<li>
							<p><span><strong>Arbitration of Most Disputes</strong>.  If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 17.1.1 within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 17.1, unless it is an Excluded Dispute, which shall be handled in accordance with Section 17.2.</span></p>
						</li>
						<!-- 17.1.3. -->
						<li>
							<p><span><strong>Arbitrator</strong>. Upon expiration of the applicable sixty (60)-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures of JAMS, Inc. ("<strong>JAMS</strong>").  JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information are available, as follows:</span></p>

						</li>
						<!-- 17.1.4. -->
						<li>
							<p><span><strong>Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong>.  In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees).  However, WITH ARBITRATION: (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.  All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.  If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the "metropolitan statistical area" (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.  You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but, if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Myspace to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 17 to be enforceable, then Myspace will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.  Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.  The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.  Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.  </span></p>

<h4 id=tracking class=type-style-3>Tracking Technologies</h4>
<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Constant Contact and our partners, including marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in many ways, including advertising, sales and marketing, analyzing trends, administering and improving the Sites, tracking users' movements around the Sites (including point of entry), gathering demographic information about our user base, verifying login status, measuring the success of a particular marketing campaign, providing improved customer service, providing more relevant content, deterring or detecting fraud, and providing users with a customized experience. We also use these technologies as part of our product offerings, including to provide our trialers and customers with information about their campaigns, such as email opens, clicks and bounces and tracking whether messages are shared and opened using our social share features. We collect information based on the use of these technologies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Sites may be limited.</p>
<p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 and Flash to, among other things, optimize screen presentation, video and other preference information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>

<h4 id=online class=type-style-3>Online Advertising</h4>
<p>We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies, such as cookies, to gather information about your activities on our Sites and other sites in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

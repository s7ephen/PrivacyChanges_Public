Domain Name Proxy Agreement
</th></tr>
<tr><td class="bodyText">
<p><strong>Last Revised: May 22, 2015</strong></p>
<p>Please read this Domain Name Proxy Agreement ("Agreement") carefully. By using the Services and/or website of Domains By Proxy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("DBP"), You (as defined below) agree to all the terms and conditions set forth both herein and in the DBP privacy policy, which is incorporated by reference and can be found by clicking <a href="http://www.domainsbyproxy.com/policy/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; You acknowledge that DBP may amend this Agreement at any time upon posting the amended terms on its website, and that any new, different or additional features changing the services provided by DBP will automatically be subject to this Agreement. If You do not agree to be bound by, or if You object to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any amendments hereto, do not use or access DBP's services. Continued use of DBP's services and its website after any such changes to this Agreement have been posted, constitutes Your acceptance of those changes.</p>
<p>This Agreement is by and between DBP and you, your heirs, assigns, agents and contractors ("You") and is made effective as of the date of electronic execution. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Your relationship with DBP and Your use of DBP's services and represents the entire Agreement between You and DBP. By using DBP's Services, You acknowledge that You have read, understand and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and You further agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement for transactions entered into by:</p>
<ol>
<li>You on Your behalf;</li>
<li>Anyone acting as Your agent; and</li>
<li>Anyone who uses the account You have established with DBP, whether or not the transactions were on Your behalf and/or authorized by You.</li>
</ol>
<p>You agree You will be bound by representations made by third parties acting on Your behalf, which either use or&nbsp;purchase services from DBP.&nbsp;You further agree that DBP will not be bound by statements of a general nature on DBP's website or&nbsp;DBP promotional materials. You further agree to abide by the terms and conditions promulgated by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") (including the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ("Dispute Resolution Policy") and Your Registrar (i.e., the ICANN-accredited person or entity through which You register a domain name).</p>
<p class="heading1">1. description of DBP's private registration services</p>
<p>When You subscribe to DBP's private registration service through a DBP-affiliated Registrar, each&nbsp;available domain name registration You designate will thereafter be registered in the name of DBP, as Registrant. In exchange for DBP becoming the Registrant of each domain name registration on Your behalf, DBP shall keep Your name, postal address, email address, phone and fax numbers confidential, subject to Section 4 of this Agreement. When DBP becomes the Registrant of Your domain name registration, the following&nbsp;information (and not Your personal information) will be made publicly available in the "Whois" directory as determined by ICANN policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>DBP's name as the Registrant of the domain name&nbsp;and a proxy email&nbsp;address, phone number and postal address for the Registrant's contact information;</li>
<li>A proxy&nbsp;postal address and phone number for the domain name registration's technical contact;</li>
<li>A proxy&nbsp;email address, postal address and phone number for the domain name registration's administrative contact;</li>
<li>A proxy email address, postal address and phone number for the domain's name registration's billing contact;</li>
<li>The primary and secondary domain name servers You designate for the domain name;</li>
<li>The domain name's original date of registration and expiration date of the registration; and</li>
<li>The identity of the Registrar.</li>
</ol>
<p class="heading1">2. full benefits of domain registration retained by you</p>
<p>Although DBP will show in the "Whois" directory as&nbsp;the Registrant of each domain name registration You designate, You will retain the full benefits of domain name registration with respect to each such domain name registration, including, subject to Section 4 below:</p>
<ol>
<li>The right to sell, transfer or assign each domain name registration, which shall require cancellation of the DBP services associated with each such domain name registration;</li>
<li>The right to control the use of each domain name registration, including designating the primary and secondary domain name servers to which each domain name points;</li>
<li>The right to cancel each domain name registration;</li>
<li>The right to cancel the DBP services associated with each domain name registration and/or Your&nbsp;privacy services with DBP so that Your contract information is listed in the "Whois" directory; and</li>
<li>The right to renew each domain name registration upon its expiration, subject to Your Registrar's applicable rules and policies.</li>
</ol>
<p class="heading1">3. PERSONAL INFORMATION AND your notification obligations; representation and warranties; ACCOUNT SECURITY</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information&nbsp;and Your Notification Obligations&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You agree that for each domain name for which DBP becomes the Registrant on Your behalf, You will provide accurate and current information as to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your name, the email address,&nbsp;postal address, phone and fax numbers for the domain name registration's Registrant contact;</li>
<li>The email address, postal address, phone and fax numbers for the domain name registration's technical contact;</li>
<li>The email address, postal address, phone and fax numbers for the domain name registration's administrative contact;</li>
<li>The email address, postal address, phone and fax numbers for the domain name registration's billing contact; and</li>
<li>You agree to provide government issued photo identification and/or government issued business identification as required for verification of identity when requested.</li>
</ol>
<p>You agree to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notify DBP within&nbsp;three (3) calendar days when any of the personal information You provided upon subscribing to DBP's services, changes;</li>
<li>Respond within three (3)&nbsp;calendar days to any inquiries made by DBP to determine the validity of personal information provided by You; and</li>
<li>Timely respond to email messages&nbsp;DBP sends to You regarding correspondence DBP has received that is either addressed to or involves You and/or Your domain name registration, as more fully set forth in Section 5(c) below.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is Your responsibility to keep Your personal information current and accurate at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Renewals </strong></p>
<p>You agree DBP, as Registrant, will&nbsp;arrange for Your Registrar to charge the credit card You have on file with the Registrar, at the Registrar's then current rates.</p>
<p>Renewal fees, once charged, will be non-refundable. You may also elect to disengage the automatic renewal feature for DBP's private registration services, by logging into Your DBP customer account&nbsp;and disabling the&nbsp;privacy service. It is Your responsibility to keep Your credit card information current and accurate, including the expiration date.</p>
<p>If for any reason DBP and/or the Registrar for Your domain name is unable to charge Your credit card for the full amount of the service provided, or if DBP and/or the Registrar is charged back for any fee it previously charged to the credit card You provided, You agree that DBP and/or the Registrar may, without notice to You, pursue all available remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to immediate cancellation of all services DBP provides to You.</p>
<p><strong>Representations and Warranties </strong></p>
<p>You warrant that all information provided by You to DBP is truthful, complete, current and accurate. You also warrant that You are using DBP's private registration services in good faith and You have no knowledge of Your domain name infringing upon or conflicting with the legal rights of a third party or a third party's trademark or trade name. You also warrant the domain name being registered by DBP on Your behalf will not be used in connection with any illegal or morally objectionable activity (as defined below in Section 4), or, in connection with the transmission of Spam, or that contains or installs any viruses, worms, bugs, Trojan horses or other code, files or programs designed to, or capable or, disrupting, damaging or limiting the functionality of any software or hardware.</p>
<p class="heading2">Account Security</p>
<p>You agree You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your customer number/login ID&nbsp;and password ("Account Access Information").&nbsp; You agree to notify DBP immediately of any unauthorized use of Your account or any other breach of security.&nbsp; You agree DBP will not be liable for any loss that You may incur as a result of someone else using Your Account Access Information, either with or without Your knowledge.&nbsp; You further agree You could be held liable for losses incurred by DBP or another party due to someone else using Your Account Access Information.&nbsp; For security purposes, You should keep Account Access Information in a secure location and take precautions to prevent others from gaining access to Your Account Access Information.&nbsp; You agree that You are entirely responsible for all activity in Your account, whether initiated by You, or by others.&nbsp; DBP specifically disclaims liability for any activity in Your account, regardless of whether You authorized the activity.</p>
<p class="heading1">4. DBP's rights to deny, suspend, terminate service and to disclose your personal information</p>
<p>&nbsp;You understand and agree that DBP has the absolute right and power, in its sole discretion and without any liability to You whatsoever, to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cancel the privacy service (which means that Your information will be available in the "Whois" directory) and/or reveal Your name and personal information that You provided to DBP when:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A. Required by law, in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or in the interest of public safety; <br />B. To comply with a legal process served upon DBP; or <br />C. In order to comply with ICANN rules, policies or procedures</li>
<li>Resolve any and all third party claims, whether threatened or made, arising out of Your use of a domain name&nbsp;for which DBP is the registrant listed in the "Whois" directory&nbsp;on Your behalf; or</li>
<li>Take any other action DBP deems necessary: <br />A. In the event you breach any provision of this Agreement or the DBP Anti-Spam Policy; <br />B.&nbsp;To protect the integrity and stability of, and to comply with registration requirements, terms, conditions and policies of, the applicable domain name Registry and/or Registry Provider;<ol><ol>C. To comply with any applicable laws, government rules or requirements, subpoenas, court orders or requests of law enforcement;&nbsp;</ol></ol>D. To comply with ICANN's Dispute Resolution Policy; <br />E. To avoid any financial loss or legal liability (civil or criminal) on the part of DBP, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, agents, officers, directors and employees; <br />F. If the domain name for which DBP is the registrant on Your behalf violates or infringes a third party's trademark, trade name or other legal rights; and <br />G. If it comes to DBP's attention that You are using DBP's services for purposes of engaging in, participating in, sponsoring or hiding Your involvement in, illegal or morally objectionable activities, including but not limited to, activities which are designed, intended to or otherwise:
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">1. Appeal purely to the prurient interests of third parties;<br />2. Defame, embarrass, harm, abuse, threaten, or harass third parties;<br />3. Violate state,&nbsp;federal or international law;<br />4. Involve hate crimes, terrorism and child pornography;<br />5. Are tortious, vulgar, obscene, invasive of a third party's privacy, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable;<br />6. Impersonate the identity of a third party;<br />7. Harm minors in any way; or<br />8. Relate to or transmit viruses, Trojan Horses, access codes, backdoors, worms, timebombs or any other code, routine, mechanism, device or item that corrupts, damages, impairs, interferes with, intercepts or misappropriates any software, hardware, firmware, network, system, data or personally identifiable information.</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You further understand and agree that if DBP is named as a defendant in, or investigated in anticipation of, any legal or administrative proceeding arising out of Your domain name registration or Your use of DBP's services, Your private registration service may be canceled, which means the domain name registration will revert back to You and Your identity will therefore be revealed in the Whois directory as Registrant.</p>
<p>In the event:</p>
<ol>
<li>DBP takes any of the actions set forth in subsection&nbsp;i, ii, or iii&nbsp;above or section 5; and/or</li>
<li>You elect to cancel DBP's services for any reason --</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither DBP nor your Registrar will refund any fees paid by You whatsoever.</p>
<p class="heading1">5. communications forwarding</p>
<p><strong>a. Correspondence Forwarding </strong></p>
<p>Inasmuch as DBP's name, postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois directory, You agree DBP will review and forward communications addressed to Your domain name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S. postal mail. You specifically acknowledge DBP will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than legal notices), "junk" mail or other unsolicited communications (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or telephone), and You further authorize DBP to either discard all such communications or return all such communications to sender unopened. You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.</p>
<p><strong>b. Email Forwarding </strong></p>
<p>The Whois directory requires an email address for every purchased domain name registration. When You purchase a private domain registration, DBP creates a private email address for that domain name, "@domainsbyproxy.com". Thereafter, when messages are sent to that private email address, DBP handles them according to the email preference You selected for that particular domain name. You have three (3) email preferences from which to choose. You can elect to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li>
<li>Have all of the messages filtered for Spam and then forwarded; or</li>
<li>Have none of the messages forwarded.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with all communications, You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive email directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.</p>
<p><strong>c. Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond </strong></p>
<p>When DBP receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed to Your domain name, in most cases, DBP will attempt to forward the mail to you via email. If&nbsp;You do not respond to the DBP email and/or the correspondence DBP has received regarding&nbsp;Your domain name registration concerns a&nbsp;dispute of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition, DBP may immediately reveal Your identity and/or cancel the DBP private registration service regarding either the domain name registration(s) in question.&nbsp;This means the Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email address and phone number that you provided to DBP.</p>
<p><strong>d.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Additional Administrative Fees </strong></p>
<p>DBP reserves the right to charge You&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;"administrative fees" or "processing fees" for (i) &nbsp;tasks DBP may perform outside the normal scope of its&nbsp;Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs DBP may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the Agreement (as determined by DBP in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios&nbsp;include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service issues that&nbsp;require additional personal time and attention; (ii)&nbsp;disputes that require accounting or&nbsp;legal services, whether performed by DBP staff or by outside firms retained by DBP; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by DBP as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or Payment Method processor.&nbsp; These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method You have on file with&nbsp;Your Registrar.</p>
<p>You agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes place relating to or arising out of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="heading1">6. limitations of liability</p>
<p><strong>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL DBP BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION, DBP'S SERVICES, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE DBP WEBSITE OR THE MATERIALS AND CONTENT OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES LINKED TO THE DBP WEBSITE OR YOUR PROVISION OF ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO DBP OR ANY THIRD PARTY. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF DBP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. BECAUSE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE LIMITATION OR ELIMINATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, DBP'S LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SMALLEST AMOUNT PERMITTED BY LAW. </strong></p>
<p><strong>YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT DBP DISCLAIMS ANY LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>THE INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE OR THEFT OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION; </strong></li>
<li><strong>ACCESS DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WEBSITE OR THE WEBSITES OF OUR AFFILIATED REGISTRARS; </strong></li>
<li><strong>DATA NON-DELIVERY OF MIS-DELIVERY BETWEEN YOU AND DBP; </strong></li>

Of course, every claim is subject to the then-carrier's investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding such claim.

<p><strong>e. Indemnification </strong></p>
<p>In the unlikely event You lose Your domain name registration to a third party solely as a result of DBP's willful misconduct, Your Registrar (the "Indemnifying Party") will indemnify and hold You harmless against any losses, damages or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any claim, action, proceeding, suit or demand arising out of or related to the loss of Your domain name registration. Such indemnification obligations under this Section 10(e) are conditioned upon the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>That You promptly give both DBP and the Indemnifying Party written notice of the claim, demand, or action and provide reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party, at its cost and expense, in connection therewith, and</li>
<li>That the Indemnifying Party has the right, at its option, to control and direct the defense to any settlement of such claim, demand, or action.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any notice concerning indemnification shall, with respect to DBP, be sent in accordance with Section 10(c) of this Agreement. With respect to Your Registrar, notices regarding indemnification should be sent in accordance with the notification provisions contained in Your Registrar's Domain Name Registration Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>f. Term of Agreement; Survival </strong></p>
<p>The terms of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as DBP is the Registrant for any domain name on Your behalf. Sections 5 (Communications Forwarding), 6 (Limitation of Liability), 7 (Indemnity), 8 (Warranty Disclaimer) and 10 (Miscellaneous Provisions) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

            Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Similar Technologies
        
            Our website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. We use cookies and web beacons to identify your device, provide website user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services, distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and understand your use of our site, and identify the name of the website from which you linked to HauteLook. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf. A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.
        
            When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This HauteLook-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your email address. Your email address and name are only saved in this HauteLook-placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.
        
            If you register with us, this HauteLook-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website. If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website. In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.
        
            We may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) or other similar technologies. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store your settings. Flash cookies may help our website visitors to, for example, set volume preference associated with a video experience, play games and perform surveys. They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to customers. We do not use Flash cookies for marketing or behavioral targeting purposes. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. Learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies. If you disable Flash cookies or other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have access to certain features and services that make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable.
        
            Third-Party Advertising Partners
        
            We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet.
        
            These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites.
        
            Our third party advertising partners may use information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from HauteLook.
        
            Currently, we use third party-placed tracking pixels and cookies from the following advertising delivery partners such as TellApart and Yahoo. In the future we may partner with other companies to provide interest-based advertising, both on and off HauteLook.com. If this occurs, you may opt-out of the partner ads by clicking on the ad and setting your opt-out.   To learn more or to opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising generally,  please visit Network Advertising Initiative.
            Social Media Interactions
        
            HauteLook invites you to socialize and share your fashion inspiration, finds and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at HauteLook.com. HauteLook does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a previously-given Facebook "Like" through HauteLook, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from HauteLook’s websites. You can also delete comments made while at HauteLook.com from your Facebook Page.
        
            For more information about Facebook Social Plugins and other social media tools, click here.
            We may allow you to sign in to your HauteLook.com account using Facebook Connect. If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within Facebook allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from HauteLook. HauteLook will always comply both with its privacy policy as well as with Facebook Connect terms regarding use of Facebook profile information.
        
            Links to Other Websites and Services
        
            Websites provided by the HauteLook and the Nordstrom family of companies may include links to other Internet sites, content, or videos (embedded or direct links) maintained by third parties ('Linked Sites').  HauteLook provides Linked Sites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of Linked Sites does not imply endorsement by HauteLook of the Linked Sites. You access Linked Sites at your own risk and by accessing them you leave HauteLook’s website. Linked Sites are not under the control of HauteLook and HauteLook is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site, including the privacy policies or tracking technologies they may use. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy to determine how they will handle any personally identifying information they collect from you.
        
            Browser Do Not Track Signals
        
            Although our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize the various web browser Do Not Track signals, we do offer our customers choices to manage their preferences that are provided in the previous sections above. To learn more about browser tracking signals and Do Not Track please visit www.allaboutdnt.org
            Security
        
            We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information transmitted to us using this website. To help guard your information, our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only HauteLook is able to decode your information. Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.
        
            To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the SSL is active and your information is secure. Most browsers offer additional security alerts as well. If for some reason you are unable to connect to our secure server, please call us toll free at 1-888-282-6060.
        
            We also ask customers to carefully review their accounts and immediately report any unexpected activity to HauteLook and their issuing bank or credit card company. Additionally, we are asking all our customers to take measures to help protect personal information in their online accounts, including the following:
        
                Install the latest security updates and anti-virus software on your computer or mobile devices to help prevent malware and viruses
            
                Reset your email account password
            
                Use complex passwords (a minimum of 7 alpha/numeric cAsE sEnsitive characters)
            
                Do not use the same password on more than one website
            
                Do not share your password with others
            
                Password protect your personal mobile device(s)
            
                Sign out/log off website sessions so that your session is closed and cannot be accessed by another user on the same computer, especially when using a public computer or terminal

            Fraud Alerts: Protecting Your Personal Information
        
            You may come in contact with websites, emails or texts that try to lure you into providing personal information with an offer such as a HauteLook or Nordstrom gift card. Nordstrom does not sponsor these offers nor are we affiliated with the promotion originators. If you become aware of any potentially fraudulent activity on a website or in an email or text, please forward the information to onlinefraud@nordstrom.com or call us at 1-888-282-6060 so that we can follow up. We take these matters, and the protection of our customers' sensitive information, very seriously. View our Fraud Alerts page.
        
            California Privacy Rights
        
            California law entitles residents to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or with corporate affiliates (such as Nordstrom Bank, and HauteLook) for those entities direct marketing purposes. HauteLook does not provide any personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you want to request a notice or have any questions about  HauteLook or Nordstrom privacy practices, please contact us at privacy@nordstrom.com.
        
            Children's Privacy
        
            HauteLook  will never knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental consent. If you are under 13 years old please do not provide your information on our website.
        
            If we become aware that an individual is under the age of 13 and has submitted any information to HauteLook for any purpose without prior verifiable parental consent, we will delete his or her information from our files.
        
            Data Processing and Storage
        
            HauteLook and its third party service providers may process or store your personal information outside of the United States or Canada and other countries. In accordance with the laws of those countries, in certain circumstances your personal information may be accessible by foreign law enforcement, regulatory bodies or other authorities. For more information of our use of foreign service providers please contact us as described below.
        
            Your Access
        
            We respect your need to be able to access and update the personal information that you have provided to us. If you have registered online, you may access and update your personal information at any time by logging into your account. You may also request access and update your personal information by email or writing to HauteLook or  the Nordstrom Privacy Office at the contact information set out below (subject to certain exceptions and as prescribed by law). We may request certain personal information to verify the identity of the individual seeking access to their personal information records.
        
            Changes to privacy policy
        
            HauteLook may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.

Our privacy policy




In short:
Ixquick does not collect or share any personal information!Nada. Zilch. Nothing.


The longer version:
Ixquick is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community. This privacy policy details the - very limited and non-personal - information Ixquick.com ("Ixquick") may gather and our disclosure policy.


IP AddressesThe IP address that is associated with your search will NOT be recorded.The only exception is for abusive (automated) queriers that rapidly submit many queries to Ixquick in a very short time.Data CollectionWe don't collect any personal information on our visitors. Nada. Zilch. Zero.When you use Ixquick, we do not record your IP address, we do not record the browser connected with your search (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome etc.), the computer platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) connected with your search, and we do not record your search words or phrases themselves.This zero data collection policy protects your privacy, since your IP address, browser, and platform information can be combined with other data to uniquely identify your computer, your location, or you. It is also important not to record search terms, since they can convey personal information as well. (Think of someone entering their own name and/or social security number.)In fact, the only information we do record is an aggregate total of how many searches are performed on our website each day (a measure of overall traffic), and, from time to time, some other strictly non-personal statistics. Such statistics may include the number of times our service is accessed by a type of operating system, a type of browser, a language, etc.or a combination thereof.We only count the numbers and are in no way able to know what your specific operating system, browser, language settings, etc may be, because we do not record that information.CookiesIxquick does not use identifying cookies.PreferencesCookies are small pieces of data that are sent and saved to your computer's hard drive when visiting sites. Ixquick uses only one anonymous cookie called "preferences". This cookie is to remember the search preferences you saved for your next visit. It expires after not visiting Ixquick for 90 days.You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. It should be noted, however, that your Ixquick.com preferences will not work properly if your cookies are turned off. It is possible to accept cookies from selected sites only.You can periodically delete cookies from your computer's hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies, you will not be recognized as a repeat visitor or viewer when returning to a site.To promote a cookie-free internet, Ixquick has a URL generator which eradicates the need for setting a cookie. It remembers your settings in a privacy friendly manner. It can be found at the bottom of the SETTINGS page.External LinksIxquick offers a proxy function that allows the users to see the information on external sites without disclosing their IP address to these sites.As a search engine, and as an advertising publisher, you will find various links on our site, including but not limited to search results and sponsored results. These sites are owned and maintained by independent companies, over which Ixquick has no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Ixquick is not liable or responsible for the content of these sites, or their collection of information and its use. To fully protect our users from the privacy risks of the FB and Twitter social media plugins we have implemented a unique two-step approach to show these icons on our site. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the Ixquick.com website. Ixquick offers a proxy function that allows the users to see the information on external sites without disclosing their IP address to these sites.  Further information on this great privacy tool can be found here. Email addresses
                         Ixquick will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties.When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to Ixquick via email or through our support center, and include an email address and/or contact information, Ixquick may use this information to respond to you. By submitting feedback you also allow us to detect which browser and operating system you are using, information that will exclusively be used for helping to better understand and solve any reported issues better.   Ixquick will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties. We may, however, very occasionally send emails to our users regarding Ixquick company information. This service is opt-in and includes the option to unsubscribe.Children Under 13 Years of AgeNote that we do not collect any personal data at all.As a consequence Ixquick does not knowingly request, collect, or share personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13 either. We feel protecting children's privacy online is very important.Information SharingIxquick has no personal information to share.Ixquick does not share personal information with any third party search engine or the provider of its sponsored results. Click here for details.Governmental requestsIxquick is headquartered in The Netherlands, Europe. Any request or demand from any government (including the US) to deliver user data, will be thoroughly checked by our lawyers, and we will not comply unless the law which actually applies to us would undeniably require it from us. And even in that hypothetical situation, we would refer to the fact we have no personal user data to share. In the fourteen years we've been in business, we have never received such a request.The only legitimate way that we see to make us start collecting personal information, is if there is a valid warrant or court order, obliging us to do so in relation to a specific user because that person is suspected to have committed a crime which is serious enough to warrant such a restriction of privacy.The Right to be ForgottenSubject to certain conditions, citizens in the EU are given the right to request the deletion of their personal data when they are inaccurate, inadequate, or irrelevant or no longer relevant. More information can be found here.Your privacy, our futureWe strongly believe that we have the legal right to safeguard the privacy of our users by encrypting and not collecting their personal information, and to keep doing so.Given the strong protection of the right to privacy in Europe, European governments cannot just start forcing service providers like us to implement a blanket spying program on their users. If that ever changed, we would fight this to the end.PrivacyIt's not just our Policy - it's our Mission!OperatorIxquick.com is owned and operated by Surfboard Holding BV, Postbus 1079,  3700 BB Zeist The Netherlands. Representative for the Privacy Policy is Robert E.G. Beens. ()



Information Sharing
Some results pages on Ixquick include a small number of clearly labeled sponsored links to cover operational costs. Those links are retrieved from platforms such as Google Adwords. The ads are NOT individually tailored to users, and Ixquick does NOT record any personal information or share personal information with the providers of sponsored links at any time. Clicking on any search result without the use of the proxy will take the user to the third-party website and away from the protection of Ixquick. This is the case with all external pages, including our sponsored links. Note: the proxy can help you visit all regular search results anonymously but as you can see, there is no such option for visiting the sponsored links, as the advertisers need means to detect click fraud scams.
Ixquick's top priority is protecting the privacy of our users, while providing a quality service.

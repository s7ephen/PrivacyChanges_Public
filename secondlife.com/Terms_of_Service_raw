Additional terms may apply to certain elements of the Service (&ldquo;Additional Terms&rdquo;); these terms are available where such separate elements are made available on the Websites.

To be clear, and without limiting the foregoing, you may not use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display or perform any Linden Inworld Content, whether modified by you or not, outside the virtual world environment of the Service except as provided in the <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Snapshot_and_machinima_policy" target="_blank">Snapshot and Machinima Policy</a> or as expressly agreed upon in a written agreement with Linden Lab. The foregoing license is referred to as a "Linden Inworld Content License." You acknowledge that when you receive a Linden Inworld Content License you do not acquire ownership of any copies of the Content, or transfer of any copyright or other intellectual property rights in the Content.<br /><br />Use of the Linden Software is subject to these Terms of Service and the terms of any applicable End User License Agreement (&ldquo;EULA&rdquo;) provided with such software. If no EULA is provided with certain Linden Software, such software is subject to the license terms set forth in this Section. Linden Lab hereby grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited, personal and revocable license to install and use the object code of the Linden Software on any Internet Device that you own or control. You may not charge any third party for using the Linden Software, and you may not modify, adapt, reverse engineer (except as otherwise permitted by applicable law notwithstanding such limitation), decompile or attempt to discover the source code of the Linden Software, or create any derivative works of the Linden Software, or otherwise use the Linden Software except as expressly provided in this Agreement. <br /><br />With respect to the source code for certain Linden Software that has been released by Linden Lab under an open source license (such as the Second Life Viewer), such software code must be used in accordance with the applicable open source license terms and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.3 You grant Linden Lab certain licenses to your User Content.</strong></p>
<p>You retain any and all Intellectual Property Rights you already hold under applicable law in Content you upload, publish, and submit to or through the Servers, Websites, and other areas of the Service, subject to the rights, licenses, and other terms of this Agreement, including any underlying rights of other users or Linden Lab in Content that you may use or modify.<br /><br />In connection with Content you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have all necessary Intellectual Property Rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Linden Lab and users of Second Life to use the Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service. <br /><br />Because the law may or may not recognize certain Intellectual Property Rights in any particular Content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for knowing, protecting, and enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights you hold, and that Linden Lab cannot do so on your behalf.<br /><br />Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section.<br /><br />Except as otherwise described in any Additional Terms (such as a contest&rsquo;s official rules) which will govern the submission of your User Content, you hereby grant to Linden Lab, and you agree to grant to Linden Lab, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, modify, display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and sell, re-sell or sublicense (through multiple levels)(with respect to Second Life, Inworld or otherwise on the Service as permitted by you through your interactions with the Service), and otherwise exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User Content (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any media, software, formula, or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. You agree that the license includes the right to copy, analyze and use any of your Content as Linden Lab may deem necessary or desirable for purposes of debugging, testing, or providing support or development services in connection with the Service and future improvements to the Service. The license granted in this Section 2.3 is referred to as the "Service Content License." <br /><br />Linden Lab has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at Linden Lab&rsquo;s cost and expense, to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint Linden Lab as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with an interest).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.4 You grant certain Content licenses to other users by submitting your Content to publicly accessible areas of the Service.</strong></p>

<h3>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFRINGEMENT NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We operate an intellectual property complaint process for complaints that User Content infringes another&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Rights, the details of which are described below and, with respect to Second Life, in our <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Intellectual_Property" target="_blank">Intellectual Property Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DMCA Notice.</strong></p>
<p>Linden Lab will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;), as set forth below. If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner&rsquo;s) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Website, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a legend or subject line that says: "DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice";<br />ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;<br />iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Website on which the material appears);<br />iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;<br />v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;<br />vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and,<br />vii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your physical signature or, if sent within an email (rather than in a physical document or a digital document attached to an email), your name typed followed by &ldquo;//s//&rdquo;, which will serve as your electronic signature.</p>
<p>Linden Lab will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, e-mail or facsimile at the addresses below:</p>
<p>By Mail:<br />Linden Research, Inc. <br />945 Battery Street<br />San Francisco, California 94111<br />Attention: Intellectual Property Team<br /><br />By E-Mail: <a href="mailto:ipteam@lindenlab.com">ipteam@lindenlab.com</a> <br />By Facsimile: 415.520.9660<br /><br />It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. Linden Lab may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Linden Lab may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.<br />Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly, materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.<br /><br />We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification (as described below).<br /><br />Without limiting Linden Lab&rsquo;s other rights, Linden Lab may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer&rsquo;s access to the Service and any other property owned or operated by Linden Lab.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DMCA Counter-Notification.</strong></p>
<p>If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to Linden Lab is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above. Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a subject line that says: "DMCA Counter-Notification";<br />ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Website from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);<br />iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;<br />iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your Account;<br />v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the United States, to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and<br />vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your physical signature or, if sent within an email (rather than in a physical document or a digital document attached to an email), your name typed followed by &ldquo;//s//&rdquo;, which will serve as your electronic signature.</p>
<p>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly, materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.<br /><br />If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service. You should also be aware that we may forward the DMCA Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedure for Alleging Infringement of Other Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>If you own intellectual property other than copyrights and believe that your intellectual property has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice to one of the addresses set forth in Section 7.1 above that includes all of the following:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a legend or subject line that says: &ldquo;Intellectual Property Infringement Notice&rdquo;;<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of the intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Website on which the material appears);<br />d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;<br />e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner of the intellectual property, its agent, or the law;<br />f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the owner of the intellectual property at issue (or, if you are not the owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of the intellectual property that is allegedly infringed); and,<br />g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your physical signature or, if sent within an email (rather than in a physical document or a digital document attached to an email), your name typed followed by &ldquo;//s//&rdquo;, which will serve as your electronic signature.</p>
<p>We will act on such notices in our sole discretion. Any user of the Service that fails to respond satisfactorily to Linden Lab with regard to any such notice is subject to suspension or termination. We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing material.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsolicited Ideas and Materials Prohibited; No Confidential or Special Relationship with Linden Lab.</strong></p>
<p>Linden Lab employs a staff of designers to develop new ideas and Linden Lab solicits and receives product idea submissions from professional inventors with whom it has business relationships.<br /><br />Because of this, in your communications with Linden Lab, please keep in mind that Linden Lab does not accept or consider any unsolicited ideas or materials for products or services, or even improvements to products or services, (collectively, &ldquo;Unsolicited Ideas and Materials&rdquo;). Therefore, you must not send to Linden Lab (even within any of your User Content that we may request), in any form and by any means, any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials. Any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials you post on or send to us via the Service are deemed User Content and licensed to us as set forth above.<br /><br />Except as otherwise specifically described in the Service&rsquo;s Privacy Statement or any Additional Terms, your relationship with Linden Lab is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship and your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials, and anything else submitted by you will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary User Content &ndash; regardless of whether you mark them &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;, &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo;, or the like. Linden Lab will not assume any responsibility, obligation, or liability for the receipt or non-receipt of any of the foregoing. Therefore, your decision to submit any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials to Linden Lab&nbsp; does not place Linden Lab&nbsp; in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.<br />Linden Lab&rsquo;s receipt of your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials is not an admission by Linden Lab of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair Linden Lab&rsquo;s right to contest existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.</p>

<h3>9. RELEASES, DISCLAIMERS, LIABILITY LIMITS AND INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1 Linden Lab is NOT liable for its users' actions, and you release Linden Lab from any claims relating to other users.</strong></p>
<p>You agree not to hold Linden Lab liable for the Content, actions, or inactions of other users. As a condition of access to the Service, you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute. <br /><br />If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.<br /><br />You agree and understand that Linden Lab does not control and is not responsible for information you provide to parties other than Linden Lab.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>9.2 Linden Lab provides the Service on an "as is" basis, without express or implied warranties, and all Content, Linden Dollars and virtual goods have no guarantee or warranty of any compensable value.</strong></p>

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE IN YOUR CONTENT OR ANY EXPENDITURE ON YOUR PART, LINDEN LAB AND YOU EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY COMPENSABLE VALUE RELATING TO OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY DATA RELATING TO YOUR ACCOUNT RESIDING ON LINDEN LAB'S SERVERS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK OF LOSS FROM USING THE SERVICE ON THIS BASIS.<br /><br />Linden Lab does not ensure continuous, error-free, secure or virus-free operation of the Service, the Linden Software, the Websites, the Servers, or your Account, and you understand that you shall not be entitled to refunds or other compensation based on Linden Lab's failure to provide any of the foregoing other than as explicitly provided in this Agreement. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties and, to that extent, the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>9.3 Linden Lab's liability to you is expressly limited, to the extent allowable under applicable law.</strong></p>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL LINDEN LAB OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, SUBSIDIARIES, AGENTS OR LICENSORS BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, ECONOMIC, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, RELIANCE, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR DISGORGEMENT OR COMPARABLE EQUITABLE REMEDY, FOR LOST DATA OR LOST PROFITS, ARISING (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE) OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE (INCLUDING ITS MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION), THE LINDEN SOFTWARE, THE WEBSITES, THE SERVERS, YOUR ACCOUNT (INCLUDING ITS TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION) OR THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT LINDEN LAB MAY HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT ANY SUCH DAMAGES MIGHT OR COULD OCCUR AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.<br /><br />EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LINDEN LAB'S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE GREATER OF (i) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00); OR (ii) THE FEES, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU FOR USE OF THE SERVICE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION WILL NOT APPLY IF A TRIBUNAL WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS SUCH TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE.<br /><br />Some jurisdictions do not allow the foregoing limitations of liability, so to the extent that any such limitation is found to be impermissible, such limitation may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, the liability of the Linden Lab parties to you is limited to the lowest amount permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.4 You agree to indemnify Linden Lab from claims relating to your use of the Service.</strong></p>
<p>At Linden Lab's request, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Linden Lab, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, and agents from all damages, liabilities, claims and expenses, including without limitation attorneys' fees and costs, arising from: (i) your User Content; (ii) your acts, omissions, or use of the Service, including without limitation your negligent, willful or illegal conduct; (iii) your breach or alleged breach by you of this Agreement, including without limitation your representations and warranties relating to your Content; (iv) your violation or anticipatory violation of any applicable law, rule or order in connection with your use of or activities in the Service; (v) information or material transmitted through your Internet Device that infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Right; (vi) any misrepresentation made by you; (vii) Linden Lab&rsquo;s use of the information that you submit to us; (viii) your purported &ldquo;ownership of any Usage Subscriptions or virtual items; or (ix) the increase or decrease in &ldquo;value&rdquo; or loss of Usage Subscriptions or virtual items if Linden Lab deletes, terminates, or modifies them (all of the foregoing, &ldquo;Claims and Losses&rdquo;) .

<h3>10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a &ldquo;written agreement to arbitrate&rdquo; pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Linden Lab agree that we intend that this Section 10 satisfies the &ldquo;writing&rdquo; requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p><br /><strong>10.1 If a dispute arises between you and Linden Lab regarding a claim, we agree to alternative dispute resolution.</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. If any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Website(s), the Content, your User Content, your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials, this Agreement, or any Additional Terms (collectively, &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;), or to any of Linden Lab&rsquo;s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an &ldquo;Excluded Dispute&rdquo;), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. However, if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this section. Your notice to us must be sent to: Linden Research, Inc., 945 Battery Street, San Francisco, CA 94111, Attention: General Counsel. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Linden and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though neither party is required to resolve such dispute on terms which each party, in its sole discretion, is uncomfortable. <br /><br />If we cannot resolve a Dispute within sixty (60) days of receipt of such notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration as hereinafter described. If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute within sixty (60) days of receipt of such notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and Linden Lab consent, in a writing signed by you and Linden Lab&rsquo;s General Counsel, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration. In such a case (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; for the remainder of this Section. <br /><br />Upon expiration of the applicable sixty (60) day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years&rsquo; experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if Linden Lab elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single, neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement and any additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. <br /><br />If you and Linden Lab do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section will not apply to the Excluded Dispute. <br />If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a &ldquo;demand for arbitration,&rdquo; then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) using JAMS&rsquo; streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of Linden Lab consent to in writing. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service. <br /><br />You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:<br />AAA: 1.800.778.7879 or <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />JAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com </a><br /><br />In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys&rsquo; fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. <br /><br />All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Linden Lab to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable, then Linden Lab will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act. <br /><br />The foregoing provisions of this Section will not apply to any legal action taken by Linden Lab to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, the Website(s), the Content, your User Content or Unsolicited Ideas and Materials and/or Linden Lab&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Rights (including such Linden Lab may claim that may be in dispute), Linden Lab&rsquo;s operations, and/or Linden Lab&rsquo;s products or services. <br /><br />Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction is unenforceable, then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 10.2 below.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.2 The applicable law and venue is in San Francisco, California.</strong></p>
<p>You agree that this Agreement and the relationship between you and Linden Lab shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. Further, you and Linden Lab agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California, except as provided in Section 10 regarding arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.3 No Equitable or Injunctive Relief.</strong></p>
<p>IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES AND DAMAGES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, CONTENT, USER CONTENT, UNSOLICITED IDEAS AND MATERIALS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, OR CONTROLLED BY LINDEN LAB (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF LINDEN LAB.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.4 Improperly Filed Claims are Subject to Attorneys' Fees and Costs.</strong></p>
<p>All claims you bring against Linden Lab must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of these Terms of Service. Should either party file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed Claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the Claim.<br /><br /><a href="#top">Return to top</a></p>

For services offered at no cost to you, such as myCARFAX, CARFAX may require you to provide an email address. CARFAX may also require a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) or license plate information to provide the relevant vehicle history information. If you submit a request for information on any CARFAX web sites, CARFAX will collect any information you submit in connection with your request, including but not limited to, name, email address, telephone number, and any personalized message included in your request. In addition, CARFAX may collect other information that you may submit in the course of searching for vehicles such as zip code and/or type of vehicle viewed. If you call a toll-free telephone number provided on any CARFAX web site, CARFAX may record the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with other information that may be captured, and all such captured information may be used as described in this Privacy Statement.
<p>CARFAX may also allow you to (1) enter information regarding your vehicle when you use myCARFAX, (2) share feedback related to third party products or services and (3) submit other content or materials through public postings on CARFAX web sites. Please be aware that if you disclose personally identifiable information or other sensitive information through such postings on CARFAX web sites the information will be viewable by others.</p>
<p>CARFAX web sites may contain <strong>web beacons</strong> to collect data regarding user traffic patterns. CARFAX web sites use <strong>cookies</strong> to collect information about your computer hardware (desktop, laptop, mobile devices etc.) and software, including but not limited to, referring domains, the type of browser used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, IP addresses and plug-ins. We may collect, or have a third party collect on our behalf, data on the number of visits, paths taken, time spent on CARFAX web sites, how visitors use and navigate through the CARFAX web sites (examples include, the number of users who visit various pages within the CARFAX web sites, information accessed by such visitors, whether they scroll up or down on particular pages or complete any forms).

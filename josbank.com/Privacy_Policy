Upon submission of your email address through the entry form, you will be automatically entered with one (1) entry into the Sweepstakes. All entries become the property of Sponsor and will not be returned or acknowledged, and Sponsor will not verify receipt of entries. Sponsor and its agencies are not responsible for lost, late, incomplete, damaged, stolen, misdirected, or illegible entries, which will be disqualified. Sponsor is not responsible for transmission, typing, and/or computer error. Limit: one entry per person during the Sweepstakes Period. Bulk, automated, or third party entries are prohibited and will be disqualified. Multiple participants are not permitted to use the same email address. Any attempt by any participant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple or different identities, forms, or email addresses or any other methods will void all of that participant’s entries, and that participant may be disqualified at Sponsor’s discretion. In the event of a dispute as to any entry, the authorized account holder of the email address used to enter will be deemed to be the registered player. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address. Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder or forfeit the prize.

You may remove your email address from future email marketing promotions by following the instructions on any email marketing promotion.  Information collected from entrants is subject to the Sponsor’s Privacy Policy, which may be found at http://www.josbank.com/privacy-policy. 
4. PRIZE DRAWINGS:  A random drawing will be held on or about the first day of each month from among all eligible entries received in the previous month.

Up to 3 alternate drawings will be held, after which any remaining prizes will remain un-awarded. No compensation will be given upon prize forfeiture for any reason. Unaccepted prizes may not be awarded within sole discretion of Sponsor. Sponsor is not responsible for any change of mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number of entrants.

We have designed this website so that you may visit it without identifying yourself or revealing any personally identifiable information, unless you opt to do so. Once you opt to provide personally identifiable information (any information that identifies you as an individual), it will be used to support your customer relationship with us and for other purposes as described in this policy, including marketing and research, customization of our websites and improving the content of our websites.

AWARENESS

Jos. A. Bank provides this Online Privacy Statement to inform you about our privacy policy for the josbank.com website and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

WHAT WE COLLECT

When making a purchase:

When you make a purchase online or by phone through our customer support center, you may be asked for information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and other contact information, and credit card information.

About Cookies

A cookie is a small data bit that resides on your browser that may contain non-personal information (such as unique user ID) that can be used to track the pages you visit while on a site. We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. In order for our web server to produce some of our advanced site features, such as signing in, or creating a shopping cart, we need to assign you cookies. In fact, without cookies, our web server would forget who you are every time you move to another page on our web site. The cookie tells the web server which cart you are using. To accomplish this, the cookie is a "session cookie" (also called "transient cookie"), which means that it will be erased when you close your web browser.

Your browser may offer tools so that you can receive a warning when cookies are used or block the use of cookies. Please note that some features of our website may not function properly if you block the use of cookies.

INFORMATION SHARING

Jos. A. Bank does not sell, exchange or make available to third parties, the email addresses or telephone numbers of customers.

If you supply us with your postal address when placing an online order, you may receive Jos. A. Bank catalogs. We may also provide your name and address to third party firms whose products you may find of interest. If you would prefer not to receive such mailings, please simply call 1-800-285-2265 or email service@jos-a-bank.com to let us know. You may receive one or two more mailings as they are printed well in advance.

Without limiting the foregoing, we may share the personal data you provide to us with our service providers; with our affiliated companies; in response to a request from law enforcement; to protect or defend other users or our company (including to enforce our terms or defend our legal rights); in response to suspected wrongdoing; or in connection with a partial or total sale of our corporate assets (including in bankruptcy).

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Josbank.com is not intended to be used by any person under the age of eighteen. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children (meaning those younger than thirteen years of age).

PRIVACY RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

Companies that collect personally identifiable information from California residents and disclose such information to third parties for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided, or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having his or her information shared with third parties. We have elected the second option, and you may request that your personally identifiable information not be shared with third parties by sending your request, including your full name, email address and postal address, to: email service@jos-a-bank.com. California residents are also entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, CA 95814; or by phone at 916-445-1254 or 800-952-5210; or by email to dca@dca.ca.gov.

ACCESS AND ACCURACY

To review or request changes to the personally identifiable information that Jos. A. Bank maintains about you, you can contact Jos. A. Bank at email service@jos-a-bank.com. To protect your privacy and security, we will ask for a password or take other reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections to your user account or travel reservations.

            <p>
                Welcome to Dashlane! Dashlane SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dashlane Inc. (a Delaware corporation) ("<strong>Dashlane</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>"), operates <a href="https://www.Dashlane.com">www.Dashlane.com</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>") and provides our users (each user, "<strong>you</strong>") with the Dashlane software application, a web assistant designed to simplify and expedite your experience on the web by holding personal data in a secure vault and actively using it to perform repetitive web actions (the "<strong>App</strong>"), as well as a number of related services (collectively, with the App, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). The following terms and conditions (the "<strong>Terms of Service</strong>") form a binding agreement between you and us regarding your use of the Site and Services.
            </p>

            <p class="very-important">
                Please read these terms of service carefully. By accessing the site and using the services you agree to be bound by these terms of service. If you are entering into these terms of service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to all of these terms and conditions, in which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not wish to be bound by these terms of service, you may not access or use this site. You hereby agree to the use of electronic communications in order to enter into this agreement, to create other records and to the electronic delivery of notices, policies and records of transactions between you and Dashlane with respect to this agreement, as further detailed in section 14. This agreement includes a class action waiver that affects your rights.
            </p>

                <li>
                    <strong class="very-important">Registration</strong>.

                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                        <li>To use our Services, you must download the App, register through the App and set up an account with us by providing your email address and selecting a password (collectively, referred to as your "<strong>Account Credentials</strong>"). You may not transfer or share your Account Credentials with any third parties, and you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account Credentials. You acknowledge and agree that we rely on Account Credentials to know whether users using our Services are authorized to do so. You agree to be responsible for any act or omission of any users that access the Site or Services under Your Account Credentials.</li>

                        <li>Dashlane enables you to share access credentials for third party accounts, such as Netflix, twitter, Hulu, etc., along with secure notes and comments (collectively, access credentials and related notes and comments are referred to as “<strong>Third Party Account Information</strong>”) with other Dashlane users that you designate (“<strong>Recipients</strong>”) and create and manage a group of Recipients that can access your Third Party Account Information (“<strong>Sharing Group</strong>”). By creating a Sharing Group, you are authorizing Dashlane to share your Third Party Account Information with the Recipients in your Sharing Group.  By granting admin privileges to a Recipient in a Sharing Group, you may also authorize Dashlane to allow that Recipient to reshare or update your Third Party Account Information. You are responsible for granting or revoking a Recipient’s access to your Third Party Account Information at all times.</li>

                        <li>You may designate an individual as your emergency contact and set parameters around release of your Third Party Account Information, including a waiting period after we receive a request from an emergency contact for you to respond to such request. You agree that provided the parameters for release are met, Dashlane may release your Third Party Account Information to any person you designate as an emergency contact and you release Dashlane from any and all liability and waive any claim you may have as a result of or in connection with such release.</li>

                        <li>In the event that you are purchasing a Dashlane Premium license that allows you to share the service offered via the Site and the App with a group of people, (“<strong>Team  Version</strong>”), then in addition to these Terms binding each individual user of the Site and App, you agree to the following:

                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                                <li>You have the authority to act on behalf of (and bind) any person or organization for which you are registering the Team Version to these Terms of Service;</li>
                                <li>Each person that you provide with a Dashlane account pursuant to your Team Version license will be provided with a copy of these Terms of Service;</li>
                                <li>You or the people or organization(s) that you have granted access to your Team Version (and not Dashlane) will be responsible for managing Account Credentials for each person to whom you grant access and you agree to pay Dashlane an annual license fee for each account.</li>
                            </ol>

                        </li>

                    <strong class="very-important">Our app</strong>.

                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                        <li>
                            <em>License</em>. Provided that you comply with the terms of this Agreement, Dashlane grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to install and use the App on a single computer, solely in object code format. This license does not entitle you to receive from Dashlane hard-copy documentation, support, telephone assistance, or enhancements or updates to the App, though we may provide any of the foregoing in our sole discretion. You may install the App on multiple devices (and we encourage you to do so), but each installation is governed by its own license. In addition to the other restrictions set forth herein, You may not incorporate, integrate or otherwise include the App or any portion thereof into any other software, program or product.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <em>Usage</em>. Now that you have the App, you will input the data you wish for the App to store, including your addresses, payment information and other personal information ("<strong>Stored Data</strong>"). You may select which category of this Stored Data (except for financial account information such as credit card numbers) ("<strong>Selected Data</strong>") is to be synchronized with our servers through the Services in accordance with our documentation. You may add any number of devices to your Account. Once you have these other devices linked to your Account, you can use your Selected Data on those devices as well. You agree and understand that this synchronization function is meant for your personal or internal business use only. You are responsible for all activities occurring with any versions of the App you install.  You must abide by all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations in connection with your use of the Services. Your Selected Data may not be available or restorable if: (a) you delete the Selected Data from the App; (b) your computer is unable to access the internet or Dashlane servers; (c) you fail to follow Dashlane’s technical requirements, including upgrading the version of your App as required; (d) you uninstall the App, or (e) you forget your password to log in to your Dashlane account.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <em>Stored Data</em>. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Stored Data. The App is designed to encrypt the Stored Data on your personal computer using AES-256 encryption, but encryption alone does not guarantee the security of the Stored Data. You are responsible for preventing unauthorized third parties from accessing that device and, if you use the Services as well, following the requirements in Dashlane’s Terms of Service. Dashlane cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the Stored Data that is inputted onto a web page by the App. As the App processes are automatic, Dashlane does not screen the Stored Data when provided through the App. <strong class="very-strong">You should confirm the accuracy of the Stored Data that is inputted onto a web page by the App each and every time you use the App.</strong> The App operates in third-party web browsers, and Dashlane has no responsibility for any such browser. Your use of these third-party browsers on third party websites will be at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties. <span class="very-important">Dashlane makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the third party websites or services, and Dashlane disclaims all liability related thereto.</span> To uninstall the App, please visit the App FAQ https://www.Dashlane.com/support/).
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <em>Usage Information</em>. When installed, the App may, from time to time, automatically report back information to Dashlane’s servers related to installation, updates, usage and errors arising in connection with your use of the App, without notice to you. These reports do not personally identify you. The primary use of this data is to help diagnose and resolve technical and performance issues in relation to the App’s compatibility with the latest operating systems. The App may also provide Dashlane with anonymous information about use of the App’s features. Dashlane uses this information in the aggregate to determine which App features are most popular and useful to its users, and to validate the continued existence and usage of an installed App. The App may also provide Dashlane with anonymous information about transactions and web actions completed using the App, for statistical and marketing purposes. The App may contain a specific identification number for the purpose of tracking the number of unique instances of the App in use. All of the data processed by Dashlane in accordance with this paragraph is <strong class="very-strong">strictly anonymous</strong> and cannot serve to identify you.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <em>No Duty to Correct Errors</em>. Without limiting the provisions of Section 2(a), you acknowledge and agree that Dashlane has no obligation under this Agreement to correct any defects or errors in the App furnished to you under this Agreement, regardless of whether you inform Dashlane of such defects or errors or Dashlane otherwise is, or becomes aware of, such defects or errors. To the extent Dashlane provides you with any updates or upgrades to the App, such updates and upgrades shall be deemed to constitute part of the App and shall be subject to all terms and provisions set forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation, terms and provisions related to licenses, use restrictions, ownership and distribution of the App. Dashlane may provide mandatory updates to the App with or without notice to you to ensure the continued performance, security and stability of the App. Dashlane may also make available other updates to the App that you will have the option to install

We reserve all rights not granted in these Terms of Service. You will immediately notify us in the event of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of any Dashlane Content.

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>OWNERSHIP</strong>.

Furthermore, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to grant, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, a license to Our Technology.  Certain of the names, logos, and other materials displayed on the Site or in the Services constitute trademarks, tradenames, service marks or logos ("Marks") of Dashlane or other entities.

                <li>
                    <strong class="very-important">Rules regarding content you provide</strong>. When you access the Site and/or Services, you obtain access to various kinds of information and materials, all of which we call "<strong>Content</strong>."  We do not consider your Stored Data as Content, but Content will include information and materials posted to a public area of the Site.  You are entirely responsible for each individual item of Content that you post or otherwise make publicly available on the Site or the Services. As between you and us, you retain ownership and any intellectual property rights in any copyrighted materials that are contained in Content that you post to the Site or through the Services.  You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, fully sublicenseable, worldwide license, under any and all of your copyright and other intellectual property rights related to that Content.  You agree that any such Content or any derivative works thereof (other than personally identifiable information about you), may be disseminated, distributed, publicly displayed, reproduced, used, sublicensed, posted, or published by us, and searched, displayed, printed or otherwise used or exploited by our customers. You agree not to revise Content posted by others. Though we strive to enforce these rules with all of our Users, you may be exposed through the Site or Services to Content that violates our policies or is otherwise offensive. You access the Site and Services at your own risk.  We may, but are not obligated to terminate your account and/or remove Content from the Site if we determine or suspect that you or your Content violates the terms of these Terms of Use or the applicable agreement with the offending User(s).

                    <strong class="very-important">Safe Search</strong>. The Dashlane “<strong>Safe Search</strong>” function is an optional enhancement offered by Dashlane that replaces your browser’s default search engine with a new search engine that provides additional security information about  each website listed in your search results, such as any past security breaches on the site, your password strength for that site, or whether the site emails your passwords back to you in plain text.  By opting in to use Safe Search, you expressly permit and authorize Dashlane to install cookies and the Safe Search executable code on your browser. You may disable Safe Search any time, which will reset your search engine to its prior state. DASHLANE PROVIDES THE SAFE SEARCH RESULTS AS A COURTESY ONLY AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT ANY RESULTS OF ANY SEARCH RESULTS NOR DOES DASHLANE ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR THE PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTY SITE OR GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF ANY THIRD PARTY SITE. SAFE SEARCH RESULTS DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT OR APPROVAL OF ANY SITE.

You consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any court located in the State of Delaware, United States.  These Terms of Service are personal to you, and you may not transfer, assign or delegate your right and/or duties under these Terms of Service to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void.  You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder.  The paragraph headings in these Terms of Service, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make these Terms of Service easier to read and have no binding effect.  Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. These Terms of Service constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator finds any provision of these Terms of Service, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the Terms of Service will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. <strong>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</strong>

The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").

                            You and Dashlane must abide by the following rules: (a) for any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing; (b) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and Dashlane, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances; (c) the arbitrator’s ruling is binding and not merely advisory; (d) <span class="very-important">any claims brought by you or dashlane must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (e) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding</span>, (f) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Dashlane will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (g) Dashlane also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (h) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (i) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Dashlane shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/Dashlane customer; and (j) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses.

                            Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dashlane may bring an individual action in small claims court.  In addition, if you are a user outside of the United States, the dispute resolution provision in our privacy policy (if any), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy.  Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision.  Such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the courts located in Wilmington, Delaware.  Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.

If, however, either subpart (d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither You nor Dashlane shall be entitled to arbitration.  In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Dashlane shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts specified in subsection "(d)" above.

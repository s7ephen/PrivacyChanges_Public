<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY DESCRIBE YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

<p>
This is the official Terms of Use Agreement ("<u>Agreement</u>") for MTV.com ("<u>Site</u>," "<u>we</u>," "<u>us</u>," or "<u>our</u>"), an Internet website offered in cooperation or connection with the MTV television channel or programming service ("<u>MTV Channel</u>"), and this Agreement applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a "<u>Device</u>"). The MTV Channel and the Site (together, "<u>MTV</u>") are provided by Viacom Media Networks ("<u>VMN</u>"), a division of Viacom International Inc. (together with VMN, the "<u>Parent Companies</u>"). This Agreement governs only the content, features, and activities related to this Site and does not cover websites for any other VMN programming channel, VMN's career website, the Parent Companies and any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, "<u>Affiliates</u>"), or any other company, unless specifically stated.</p>

<p>
This Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions ("<u>U.S.</u>") and certain features on this Site (including, but not limited to, user registration and newsletter signups) may be subject to heightened age and/or other eligibility requirements. <b>If you are not yet 13 years old or the required greater age for certain features, do not reside in the U.S. and/or do not meet any other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Site immediately or, if for any reason, you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, please discontinue using the Site immediately, because by using or attempting to use the Site, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age or other required greater age for certain features and meet any other eligibility and residency requirements of the Site.</b>
</p>

<p>
These terms and conditions regarding your use of the Site constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the Site and the Parent Companies. In this Agreement, the term "Site" includes all websites and web pages within the Site as well as any equivalent, mirror, replacement, substitute or backup websites and web pages that are associated with the Site. By using this Site, you understand, acknowledge and agree that you will abide by the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms that govern certain products and services, which will be presented in conjunction with those products and services ("<u>Additional Terms</u>"), including but not limited to, the <a href="/sitewide/legal/user_content.jhtml">User Content Submission Agreement</a> which governs your submission of User Content as such term is defined therein, and the <a href="/sitewide/mtvinfo/virtual_terms.pdf">Virtual Reality Applications - Terms</a> which governs your use of the virtual reality applications accessible from the Site. The Site may also provide rules of participation ("Rules") for certain activities and services including, but not limited to, contests and sweepstakes, award programs, membership clubs, email, and dating services. The Site's Additional Terms, <a href="/sitewide/legal/privacy.jhtml">Privacy Policy</a> and the Rules are hereby incorporated in this Agreement by reference. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and Additional Terms for the activity in which you choose to participate, the Additional Terms shall govern. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and the specific Rules for the activity in which you choose to participate, the Rules shall govern. This Agreement will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and in the event of termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still be bound by your obligations under this Agreement, the <a href="/sitewide/legal/privacy.jhtml">Privacy Policy</a>, any Additional Terms or Rules, including any indemnifications, warranties and limitations of liability.</p>

<p>
The words "<u>use</u>" or "<u>using</u>" in this Agreement, means any time an individual (a "<u>user</u>"), directly or indirectly, with or without the aid of a machine or device, does or attempts to access, interact with, use, display, view, print or copy from the Site, transmit, receive or exchange data or communicate with the Site, or in any way utilizes, benefits, takes advantage of or interacts with any function, service or feature of the Site, for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement does not cover your rights or responsibilities with respect to third party content or sites or any links that may direct your browser or your connection to third party sites or pages. This is the entire and exclusive Agreement between you and us regarding use of the Site and it cannot be modified, except as specifically described below in Section 2.</p>

<h2 class="title2">1. Registration</h2>

<p>
We may require each user to have a unique user name and password combination in order to access and use certain features or functions of the Site and may also, from time to time, provide users with additional codes or passwords necessary to access and use certain features or functions of the Site. Please read our <a href="/sitewide/legal/privacy.jhtml">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes the personally identifiable information ("<u>Personal Information</u>") we collect, use, disclose, manage and store. As part of the registration process for the feature or function, you will choose a user name and password (or we may assign an initial password which we will give you the option to change). Your user name and password are personal to you and you may not allow any others to use your user name or password under any circumstances. We are not liable for any harm caused or related to the theft or misappropriation of your user name or password, disclosure of your user name or password, or your authorization of anyone else to use your user name or password. You agree to immediately notify us if you become aware of or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of (or activity using) your user name or password or any other need to deactivate your user name or password due to security concerns.</p>

<h2 class="title2">2. Modifications</h2>

<p>
We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in our sole discretion, to change the terms of this Agreement. We will post or display notices of material changes on the Site and/or e-mail you or notify you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. Once we post them on the Site, these changes become effective immediately and if you use the Site after they become effective it will signify your agreement to be bound by the changes.

<h2 class="title2">3. Ownership Of Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>
The contents of this Site, including all Site software, design, text, images, photographs, illustrations, audio and video material, artwork, graphic material, databases, proprietary information and all copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable elements of the Site, including, without limitation, the selection, sequence and 'look and feel' and arrangement of items, and all trademarks, service marks and trade names (individually and/or collectively, "<u>Material</u>"), are the property of the Parent Companies, and their Affiliates, and any of their successors and assigns, and any of their respective licensors, Advertisers (as defined below), suppliers, and operational service providers and are legally protected, without limitation, under U.S. Federal and State, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and treaties.

Any unauthorized or prohibited use of any Material may subject you to civil liability, criminal prosecution, or both, under applicable federal, state and local laws. We require users to respect our copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. We likewise respect the intellectual property of others. On notice, we will act expeditiously to remove content on the Site that infringes the copyright rights of others and will disable the access to the Site and its services of anyone who uses them to repeatedly to infringe the intellectual property rights of others.</p>

Privacy Policy | PersonalizationMall.com



PersonalizationMall.com® Privacy Policy
PersonalizationMall.com, Inc., its related companies and affiliates ("PMall"), has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our visitors and registered users/members. This Privacy Policy governs PMall's information gathering, use and dissemination practices through the website: www.personalizationmall.com ("Website"), as well as any affiliated websites. 
PMall does not rent or sell your personally identifiable information for third-party marketing or solicitation purposes.
1. What information is collected?
As detailed below, PMall collects certain information from visitors and registered users of the Website. 
The Website uses personalization and order forms for customers to request products and services. During personalization/order submission and fulfillment, PMall collects the customer's personally identifiable and financial information, i.e. names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card numbers, PayPal information, etc. ("PII"). Additional information may be collected if you choose to (1) join our email list; (2) register and create an account; (3) participate in the My Personal Rewards program; or (4) participate in the customer review posting program, including: name, date of birth, email address, city, state/province, country, password, password hints, photographs (persona), product review information and other information related to purchases from, and experiences with, PMall. 
Like most Internet retailers, PMall collects some computer information to enhance its product/service offerings and personally tailored marketing, such as computer configuration; Internet Protocol address; the URL of the website that sent you to PMall's Website; the URL of the website that you went to after leaving PMall's Website; and/or search terms that directed you to our Website. In addition, when you visit our website or one of our business partners' websites, a "cookie" may be placed on your computer that collects information to enhance and personalize PMall's offerings and promotions, and to deliver direct personalized marketing from PMall. To opt out of direct online advertising provided by PMall click here. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. Last, PMall may receive information about you from other sources and add it to its database.
2. How is the information shared?
PMall is not in the business of selling PII and does not rent or sell your PII for third-party marketing or solicitation purposes. PMall may share PII with its business partners and affiliates as part of PMall's marketing, promotion, sale and fulfillment of its products and services. Customer reviews may be published on the Website, viewable by both registered users and visitors and are subject to the Customer Review Posting Policy & Agreement. PMall also may collect, share, sell and use information in aggregate form, but such information will not include PII. Last, PMall may need to disclose PII to government or law enforcement authorities as required by law. Under such circumstances, we will disclose the information upon a good faith belief that is necessary to comply with the order, request, form of legal process, or otherwise defend or exercise PMall's rights. 
We may share your personally-identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline with us with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our advertising partner and its service provider are contractually required to make the data we provide anonymous.
Please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/choices) to learn more about the use of this information by third-party advertising companies or to choose limited use of this information by opting out of interest-based online advertising. Please Note that if you disable the display of personalized ads from these advertising partners, you will continue to receive ads that are less relevant to your interests.
